The Unicode Standard, Version 5.2 - Code Charts

The file "CodeCharts-noHan.pdf" contains all charts for Unicode 5.2
except for Han script blocks that are printed in multi-column format.

The file "CodeCharts-MulticolHan.pdf" contains the multi-column
Han blocks.

These two large code chart files are not independently paginated.
Instead, they are paginated as if they were assembled as a single
large file of 2000+ pages, in Unicode code point order.

The file "RSIndex.pdf" is the complete Unihan Radical
Stroke Index.

These files are stable. They will not be updated with errata, or
when additional characters are assigned to the Unicode Standard. See
http://www.unicode.org/charts/ for access to a complete list of the
latest character code charts. See http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-5.2/
for charts showing only the characters added in Unicode 5.2. Both of
these locations provide access to multiple files for convenient on-line
viewing of individual code tables.

Fonts
The shapes of the reference glyphs used in these code charts are not
prescriptive. Considerable variation is to be expected in actual fonts.
The particular fonts used in these charts were provided to the Unicode
Consortium by a number of different font designers, who own the rights
to the fonts. See http://www.unicode.org/charts/fonts.html for a list.

Terms of Use
The terms of use for the character code charts differ from the general
terms of use for the Unicode web site or the Unicode Character Database.

You may freely use these code charts for personal or internal business
uses only. You may not incorporate them either wholly or in part into
any product or publication, or otherwise distribute them without express
written permission from the Unicode Consortium. However, you may provide
links to these charts.

The fonts and font data used in production of these Code Charts may NOT
be extracted, or used in any other way in any product or publication,
without permission or license granted by the typeface owner(s).

The Unicode Consortium is not liable for errors or omissions in these
character code charts or any other part of the Unicode Standard itself.
