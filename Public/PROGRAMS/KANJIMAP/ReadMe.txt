The KANJIMAP tool provides an example of how to convert from Unicode to
Shift-JIS with a compact table. This method can easily be extended to
work for other East Asian character sets. See KANJIMAP.H for details.

This tool is provided as-is by Unicode, Inc.  The MAKEFILE may not work
on your system; you may have to modify to suit, and include any necessary
libraries on the link line.
