Note: The CLDR release consists of 3 zip files:

- core.zip contains the collation, main, segments, supplemental, and transforms directories
- posix.zip contains generated POSIX data. Note that the CLDR tools can be used to generate variants of this data
- test.zip contains the test data files (with a readme)

The posix and test files for 1.4 are staged after the core files.
