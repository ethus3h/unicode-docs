The "ucd" subdirectory contains contributory data files associated
with the Unicode Character Database. These files have been moved 
into a subdirectory to facilitate the inclusion in the 4.1.0 
directory of other versioned files that are not part of the Unicode
Character Database per se.

The "charts" subdirectory contains an archival set of
pdf code charts corresponding exactly to Version 4.1.0.

Zipped versions of UCD data files for Version 4.1.0 are posted in:
