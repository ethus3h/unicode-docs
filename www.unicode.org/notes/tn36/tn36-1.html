	<h2><a name="Introduction">1 Introduction</a></h2>
	
<p>Implementers frequently want to extract good categories for Unicode
characters from the Unicode names list. For example,
such categories may be needed to develop new character picker applications,
which organize characters into groups that will
make sense for people searching for characters in graphic panes
or other UI elements.</p>

<p>There are two parts to this problem. First, the existing machine-readable
data files in the Unicode Character Database [<a href="tn36-1.html#UCD">UCD</a>] 
do not provide a fine enough categorization to
meet the requirements of such applications. For example, the General_Category
property distinguishes letters from combining marks
and punctuation and symbols, but it doesn't drill down
to the next level: independent vowel letters versus
consonants versus matras; or game symbols versus map
symbols versus zodiac symbols versus dingbats, and
so on. Second, people who need more finely detailed categorization have been attempting to extract
it by making use of the editorial subheaders used in
the printing of the Unicode names list, figuring that
such information is better than nothing, and assuming that doing
the finer-level classification from scratch would be
prohibitively complex.</p>

<p>However, the subheaders in the Unicode
names list have always been editorial content aimed primarily at
structuring the code charts for display, and are not
particularly well-suited to a systematic categorization
of Unicode characters in any context more extensive than
visual display, one chart at a time. Efforts to revise the
subheaders to make them work better for machine-extracted
categorization of Unicode characters from the Unicode
names list are counterproductive. The subheaders would not
work very well if reorganized that way, and the net result would be a
significant deterioration of the editorial content of
the code charts.</p>

<p>The existing
subheaders also group characters which other applications
might want to distinguish. For example, the
header for the range U+2600..U+260D is "Weather and astrological 
symbols". But it is possible to do much
better, distinguishing more precisely those which are
weather symbols, such as U+2602 UMBRELLA, those which
are astrological symbols, such as U+260A ASCENDING NODE,
and those which really are not either, such as U+2606 WHITE STAR.</p>

<p>This document presents an approach that focuses
on the character category distinctions needed by such applications,
without being entangled with the editorial requirements for
the Unicode names list maintenance. It also describes a data file that implementers
can use for further refining of Unicode character categories
for particular applications.</p>


	<h2><a name="Character_Categories">2 Character Categories</a></h2>
	
<p>This section describes the approach taken in this note for
providing a set of usable categories for Unicode characters.</p>
	
	<h3>2.1 <a name="Hierarchical_Typology">Hierarchical Typology</a></h3>

<p>This scheme of categorization uses a hierarchical typology,
which assumes that each category provided may itself be further
subdivided at another level into more subcategories. Each subcategorization
is, in principle, independent of the subcategorization of other categories.
Thus, for example, how one might want to subcategorize letters would
typically be quite distinct from how one might most usefully subcategorize
punctuation marks. Such an approach departs from the structure of
partition properties for Unicode characters, such as the General_Category
property. A partition property assumes a single dimension of
semantic applicability, and then assigns every character a single value
within that dimension. Such a character property is easy to implement,
but as users of the General_Category property well know, the drawback
of such partitions for categorization is their rigidity and the inability
to deal with edge cases, overlapping function, and subcategories.</p>

<p>The approach to categorization taken here makes no assumption that 
any particular level of the hierarchical subcategorization
has any fixed significance. A third-level subcategorization of a punctuation
mark might involve rather different salient distinctions than a third-level
subcategorization of symbols, for example. The typology basically
starts with first-level categories roughly based on the General_Category
property, but then may diverge arbitrarily on a category-by-category basis,
depending on what is most useful for distinguishing characters within
each subgroup.</p>

<p>There is no assumption that all levels have to be specified for all
characters. Categories defined this way can  
be extensible based on what level of detail
people find useful to maintain for various characters. There is also
no assumption that there is actually a single correct solution for
categorization. The categorization may be modified and improved over time.
Furthermore, it should be expected that actual implementations will merely
start with categories in the data file and run with them, to provide
whatever additional changes or refinements are needed in their particular
domain.</p>

<p>These general principles are illustrated in part by the following examples,
for several different major categories. For example, for letters:</p>

<pre>
Letter

Letter > Vowel

Letter > Vowel > Dependent  (i.e. Indic matras)

Letter > Consonant > Dependent > Subjoined
</pre>

<p>For symbols:</p>

<pre>
Symbol

Symbol > Graphic

Symbol > Technical

Symbol > Technical > Keyboard

Symbol > Arrow

Symbol > Arrow > Harpoon

Symbol > Arrow > Harpoon > Double
</pre>

<p>For punctuation marks:</p>

<pre>
Punctuation

Punctuation > Space

Punctuation > Quotation

Punctuation > Bracket

Punctuation > Bracket > CJK
</pre>

<p>Currently the categorization makes use of four levels of hierarchy, but
this approach could easily be extended to five (or more), if finer
levels of distinction for some groups of characters prove
to be desirable. For example, arrows could be further subcategorized
based on their shapes and orientations.</p>

	<h3>2.2 <a name="Category_Names">Names for Categories</a></h3>
	
<p>Each level of hierachical categorization is given a conventional
name, such as "Letter" or "Symbol" for the highest level, or "Game", "Technical",
"Weather", "Astrological", and so for, for various sub-levels. As far as possible,
such names are drawn from actual practice in the Unicode Standard and in the
UTC committee practice in referring to various groups of characters.</p>

<p>There are no "empty" intermediate levels. Thus, for instance, if a name
is given in the date file for a fourth level subcategorization for a particular
character, there will also always be explicit names given at the first, second,
and third level of categories for that character.</p>

	<h3>2.3 <a name="Display_Labels">Display Labels for Categories</a></h3>
        
<p>Because of the way the hierarchical categorization works, and
the way in which names are chosen for the subcategories, it is always possible to
create unique identifiers for each terminal subcategory in the hierarchy,
simply by concatenating the level names together. Thus, for example, one could
have identifiers such as "Letter_Consonant_Dependent_Subjoined" or "Symbol_Technical_Keyboard".
However, while unique, such identifiers are not particularly felicitous as
display labels for subcategories.</p>

<p>Implementers can, of course, apply whatever display labels make
sense for their particular context. Some principles which might serve
to make usable display labels include:</p>
	
<ul>
	<li>Each display label should be meaningful in isolation.</li>
   	<li>Display labels should be the same (or nearly the same) only when they really mean the same thing.</li>
        <li>As much as possible, display labels should follow common practice
            in referring to identified groups of characters, to avoid creating
            new, artificial terminology that would be difficult to translate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although principles such as these are generally good practice, 
some of the categorial distinctions between Unicode characters
are rather technical in nature. Also, there are many characters in the Unicode
Standard for writing systems which are mostly unfamiliar to the English-speaking
world. In such cases, it is occasionally unavoidable that technical terminology would end
up being used in any comprehensive list of display labels.</p>
 
        <h3>2.4 <a name="Informative_Status">Informative Status of the Categories</a></h3>
        
<p>The categories defined in the data file for this technical note are informative only, have no status in
the Unicode Standard itself, and
may be changed or augmented in the future. This distinguishes them from
the General_Category character property of the Unicode Standard, which is normative and rather
constrained by stability guarantees in how it can be changed.</p>
	
	<h3>2.5 <a name="Non_Goals">Categorical Distinctions not Addressed by this Note</a></h3>
        
<p>The are many possible ways to categorize Unicode characters. The approach taken
in this note and the accompanying data file is only one among the many possibilities.
To avoid misconceptions about the intent of this categorization, this section lists
a few of the kinds of distinctions which are <i>not</i> addressed by the data.</p>

<p>The data does not attempt a <b>shape-based classification</b> of glyphs for Unicode
characters. There are no categories which identify all of the "dots", the
"circles", the "squares", the "crosses", or any other such shape-based categories.</p>

<p>The data does not attempt a <b>phonological-based classification</b> of the
usage of Unicode characters. There is no attempt to identify, across all
scripts, classes such as "consonant", "vowel", and so forth. The few instances
where "consonant" and "vowel" appear in categories relate to subgrouping of
characters in abugida-type scripts, where the classification actually is built
into the structure of the script, and where the distinctions between consonants
(with inherent vowel), independent vowels, and dependent vowels (matras) are relevant
to the encoding decisions regarding the repertoire of characters for the script.
In my opinion, for most scripts, even attempting a phonological classification
at the character level is hopeless, because phonological status is not inherent
to the characters per se, but rather results from the usage of a character (or
sequence of characters) to represent data in particular orthographies for
particular languages.</p>

<p>The data does not attempt a <b>historical status-based classification</b> of
Unicode characters. While there are occasional indications that some subgroup
of characters is "historic", derived either from existing subheaders in the Unicode names
list or general information provided in character proposals, there is no attempt
to comb through thousands of individual characters and for each of them determine
which is in current usage and which is obsolete or historic.</p>

<p>The data does not attempt a <b>commonality-based classification</b> of Unicode characters.
There are no subcategories such as "common" or "rare" in the data.</p>

<p>The data should not be confused with the kind of classification of characters
used in determining <b>collation weighting</b> of Unicode characters. 
Issues of whether particular characters make secondary weight distinctions, or
whether particular compatibility characters are treated as tertiary weight variants
of other base characters, and so forth, have no place in the categories data. For
such concerns, see [<a href="tn36-1.html#UTS10">UTS10</a>].
        
	<h2><a name="Data_File">3 Data File</a></h2>

<p>The basic categories data is available in a data file [<a href="tn36-1.html#Data">Data</a>] called
Categories.txt. That data file contains a listing of all Unicode characters
other than CJK unified ideographs and Hangul syllables, giving informative category values
at up to four levels of hierarchical assignment.</p>

<p>The data is formatted in tab-delimited fields, suitable for spreadsheet import.
Once in a spreadsheet, the data can easily be further manipulated to whatever end
an implementer needs.</p> 

<p> The
field values, along with a sample of the particular category values are shown below.</p>

<pre>
<b>Code GC Level1    Level2       Level3      Level4       Name</b>

23CE So Symbol    Technical    Keyboard                 RETURN SYMBOL

...
A869 Lo Letter    Consonant                             PHAGS-PA LETTER TTA
...
</pre>


	<h3>3.1 <a name="Maintenance">Maintenance of the Data File</a></h3>
	
<p>The approach taken to maintaining this hierarchical typology reuses
technology which is currently designed for maintenance of the Unicode
names list. In particular, category assignments are treated as annotations
over ranges of characters. The annotation file can then be maintained
completely independently of the detailed, character-by-character listing
files that are part of the UCD&#x2014;most importantly, UnicodeData.txt. In this
way, the annotation information (and the associated development and
refinement of categorial assignments) can be version-agnostic, and
is not required to be updated in lockstep with each version of the
Unicode Standard.</p>
	
<p>The program that is used to maintain 
annotations for the Unicode names list has been modified slightly and 
then used for an automated merger of 
categorial annotations file with particular versions of the UnicodeData.txt file, 
producing as output a
structured data file containing categorial information
about all Unicode characters, with an explicit listing for each
separate character, including its code point and Unicode character name.</p>

<p>The merge process omits CJK unified ideographs and Hangul syllables.
Categorial information about CJK unified ideographs is better handled
by other means, and in particular by the Unihan database. The 11,172 Hangul
syllables do not have useful categorial distinctions in ways relevant
to other Unicode characters, so including all of them explicitly as part
of a category listing would simply be redundant.</p>
