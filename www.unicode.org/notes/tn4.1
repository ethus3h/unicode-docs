  <h3><i>Summary</i></h3>
  <p><i>This paper by Michael Everson was presented at the 21st International 
  Unicode Conference in May 2002. It observes that an examination of the Roadmap shows that there are at present no less than 92 scripts yet to be encoded! These scripts range from large, complex and famous dead scripts like Egyptian hieroglyphs, to small, little-known but simple scripts like Old Permic. But, importantly, about a third of the scripts are living scripts which are intended to go on the BMP. Over the past few years, some implementers and standardizers alike have expressed their concern about how much work remains to be done. "When will the standard be finished?" they have asked. This Technical Note  gives a brief overview of the history of Unicode allocations, and discusses the standardization process required for newly-allocated scripts, including  the kinds of procedural, political, and implementation issues which are met with in trying to get a script standardized. The different types of scripts remaining to be encoded are discussed with regard to the ease with which they can be both encoded and implemented. Finally, a proposal for the way forward is given.
