  <h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
  <p>There is often a good deal of confusion about what is meant by the terms 
  &quot;stable&quot; or &quot;deterministic&quot; when applied to sorting or 
  comparison. This confusion in terms often leads people to make mistakes in 
  their software architecture, or make choices of language-sensitive comparison 
  options that have significant impact in terms of performance and footprint, 
  and yet do not give the results that users expect.</p>
  <p>This technical note describes the meaning of each of these term in the 
  proper context, and clarifies their usage and implications.</p>
  <h2><a name="Stable_Sort">Stable Sort</a></h2>
  <p>A stable sort is one where two records will retain their order when sorted 
  according to a particular field, even when the two fields have the same 
  contents. Thus those two records come out in the same relative order that they 
  were in before sorting, although their positions relative to other records may 
  change. Importantly, this is a property of the sorting algorithm, <i>not</i> 
  the comparison mechanism.</p>
  <p>Two examples of differing sorting algorithms are Quick Sort and Merge. 
  Quick Sort is not stable while Merge Sort is stable. (A Bubble Sort, as 
  typically implemented, is also stable.)</p>

  <p>As you see from the above, the Quicksort algorithm is not stable; the 
  records 1 and 2 are not in the same order they were in before sorting.</p>
  <p>A stable sort is often desired; for one thing, it allows records to be 
  successively sorting according to different fields, and retain the correct 
  lexigraphic order. Thus with a stable sort, one could all the records by 
  First_Name, then sort all the records by Last_Name, giving the desired 
  results: that all records would be sorted by Last_Name, and where the 
  Last_Names are the same, sorted by First_Name.</p>
  <h2><a name="Deterministic_Sort">Deterministic Sort</a></h2>
  <p>A <i>deterministic</i> sort is a very different beast. This is a sort 
  algorithm that returns the same results each time. On the face of it, it would 
  seem odd for any sort algorithm to <i>not</i> be deterministic, but there are 
  examples of real-world sort algorithms that aren't.</p>
  <p>The key concept is that these sort algorithms <i>are</i> deterministic when 
  two records have unequal fields, but they may return different results at 
  different times when two records have equal fields.</p>
  <p>For example, a classic Quick Sort algorithm works recursively on ranges of 
  records. For any given range of records, it takes the first element as the <i>pivot 
  element</i>. We're not going to explain the details here, but that algorithm 
  performs badly with input data that happens to be sorted (or mostly sorted). A 
  randomized Quick Sort, which picks a random element as the pivot, can on 
  average be faster. The results it gets are not deterministic; from <i>exactly </i>the 
  same input, different results can be output:</p>

  <p>As another example, multiprocessor sorting algorithms can be 
  non-deterministic. The work of sorting different blocks of data are farmed out 
  to different processors and then merged back together. The ordering of records 
  with equal fields might be different according to when different processors 
  finish different tasks.</p>
  <p>Note that a deterministic sort is weaker than a stable sort. A stable sort 
  is always deterministic, but not vice versa. And typically when people say 
  they want a deterministic sort, they really mean that they want a stable sort.</p>
  <h2><a name="Deterministic_Comparison">Deterministic Comparison</a></h2>
  <p>A <i>deterministic comparison</i> is different than either of the above; it 
  is a property of a comparison function, <i>not</i> a sorting algorithm. This 
  is a comparison where strings that do not have identical binary contents 
  (optionally, after some process of normalization) will compare as unequal. A 
  deterministic comparison is sometimes called a <i>stable</i> (or <i>semi-stable</i>) 
  <i>comparison</i>.</p>
  <p>There are many people who confuse a deterministic comparison with a 
  deterministic (or stable) sort, but once again, these are <i>very</i> 
  different creatures. A comparison is used by a sorting algorithm to determine 
  the relative ordering of two fields, such as strings. Using a deterministic 
  comparison <i>cannot</i> cause a sort to be deterministic, nor to be stable. 
  Whether a sort is deterministic or stable is a property of the sort algorithm, 
  <i>not</i> the comparison function. If you look at the examples above, this is 
  clear.</p>
  <h3><a name="Forcing_Deterministic_Comparisons">Forcing Deterministic 
  Comparisons</a></h3>
  <p>One can produce a deterministic comparison function from a 
  non-deterministic one, in the following way (in pseudo-code):</p>
  <pre>int new_compare (String a, String b) {
  int result = old_compare(a, b);
  if (result == 0) {
    result = binary_compare(a, b);
  }
  return result;
}</pre>
  <p>Programs typically also provide the facility to generate a <i>sort key</i>, 
  which is a sequences of bytes generated from a string in alignment with a 
  comparison function. Two sort keys will binary-compare in the same order as 
  their original strings.&nbsp; To create a deterministic sort key that aligns 
  with the above <code>new_compare</code>, the simplest means is to append a 
  copy of the original string to the sort key. This will force the comparison to 
  be deterministic.</p>
  <pre>byteSequence new_sort_key (String a) {
  return old_sort_key(a) + SEPARATOR + toByteSequence(a);
}</pre>
  <p>Because sort keys and comparisons must be aligned, a sort key generator is 
  deterministic if and only if a comparison is.</p>
  <h3><a name="Best_Practice">Best Practice</a></h3>
  <p>However, a deterministic comparison is generally not best practice. First, 
  it has a certain performance cost in comparison, and a quite substantial 
  impact on sort key size. (For example, [<a href="index.html#ICU">ICU</a>] 
  language-sensitive sort keys are generally about the size of the original 
  string, so appending a copy of the original string generally <i>doubles</i> 
  the size of the sort key.)&nbsp; A database using these sort keys can have 
  substantially increased disk footprint and memory footprint, and consequently 
  reduced performance.</p>
  <p>More importantly, a deterministic comparison function does not actually 
  achieve the effect people think it will have. Look at the sorted examples 
  above. Whether a deterministic comparison is use or not, there will be <i><b>no</b></i> 
  effect on Quick Sort example, since the two records in question have identical 
  last name fields. It does not make a non-deterministic sort into a 
  deterministic one, nor does it make a non-stable sort into a stable one.</p>
  <p>Thirdly, a deterministic comparison is often not what is wanted, when 
  people look closely at the implications. Look at our above example, and 
  suppose that this time the user is sorting first by last name, then by first 
  name.</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
      <caption>Original Records</caption>
      <tr>
        <th>Record</th>
        <th>Last_Name</th>
        <th>First_Name</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><font color="#00FF00">1</font></td>
        <td>Davis</td>
        <td>John</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>Fred</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>The desired results are the following, which should result whether the 
  sorting algorithm is stable or not, since we are using both fields.</p>

  <p>Now suppose that in record 2, the source for the data caused the last name 
  to contain a control character, such as a ZWJ (used to request ligatures on 
  display). There is in this case no visible distinction in the forms, since the 
  font doesn't have any ligatures for these values. The standard UCA collation 
  sequence causes that character to be—correctly—ignored in comparison, 
  since it should only affect rendering. However, if that comparison is changed 
  to be deterministic (by appending the binary original string, then unexpected 
  results will occur.</p>

  <h3><a name="Forcing_Stable_Sorts">Forcing Stable <i>Sorts</i></a></h3>
  <p>Typically, what people really want when they say they want a deterministic 
  comparison is actually a stable sort.</p>
  <p>One <i>can</i> force non-stable sorting algorithm to produce stable results 
  by how one does the comparison. However, it has literally nothing to do with 
  making the comparison be deterministic or not. Instead, it can be done by 
  appending the <i>current record number</i> to the strings to be compared. (The 
  implementation may not actually append the number; it may use some other 
  mechanism, but the effect would be the same.)</p>
  <p>If such a modified sort comparison is used, for example, then it forces 
  Quick Sort to get the same results as Merge Sort. And in that case, the 
  irrelevant character ZWJ does not affect the outcome, as illustrated below, 
  and the correct results occur.</p>

  <h2><a name="Stable_Comparison">Stable Comparison</a></h2>
  <p>There are a few other terms worth mentioning, simply because they are also 
  subject to considerable confusion. Any or all of the following may be easily 
  confused with above.</p>
  <p>A <i>stable comparison</i> is one that does not change over successive 
  software versions. That is, as one uses successive versions of an API, with 
  the same &quot;settings&quot; (such as locale), one gets the same results.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For more information on the stability of language-sensitive comparisons, 
      see [<a href="index.html#UTS10">UTS10</a>].</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A <i>stable sort key generator</i> is one that generates the same binary 
  sequence over successive software versions.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Warning: </b>if the sort key generator is stable, then the associated 
    comparison will perforce be. However, the reverse is not guaranteed. To take 
    a trivial example, suppose the new version of the software always adds an 
    0xFF byte at the front of every sort key. The results of any comparison of 
    any two <i>new</i> keys would be identical to the results of the comparison 
    of any two corresponding <i>old</i> keys. But the bytes have changed, and 
    the comparison of old and new keys would give different results. Thus one 
    can have a stable comparison, yet an associated non-stable sort key 
    generator.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>A <i>portable comparison</i> is where corresponding APIs for comparison 
  produce the same results across different platforms. That is, if one uses the 
  same &quot;settings&quot; (such as locale), one gets the same results.</p>
  <p>A <i>portable sort key generator </i>is where corresponding sort key APIs 
  produce exactly the same sequence of bytes across different platforms.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Warning: </b>as above, a comparison may be portable without the 
    associated sort key generator being portable.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Ideally, all products would have the same string comparison and sort key 
  generation for, say Swedish, and thus be portable. For historical reasons, 
  this is not the case. Even if the main letters sort the same, there will be 
  differences in the handling of other letters, or symbols, punctuation, and 
  other characters. There are some libraries that offer portable comparison, 
  such as [<a href="index.html#ICU">ICU</a>], but in general the results of comparison or 
  sort key generation may vary significantly between different platforms.</p>
  <p>In a closed system, or in simple scenarios, portability may not matter. 
  Where someone has a given set of data to present to a user, and just wants the 
  output to be reasonably appropriate for Swedish, then the exact order on the 
  screen may not matter.</p>
  <p>In other circumstances, it can lead to data corruption. For example, 
  suppose that two implementations do a database SELECT for records between a 
  pair of strings. If the collation is different in the least way, they can get 
  different data results. Financial data might be different, for example, if a 
  city is included in one SELECT on one platform and excluded from the same 
  SELECT on another platform.</p>
  <p>There are efforts to try to come to some common ground on these sorts of 
  issues. See [<a href="index.html#CommonLocale">CommonLocale</a>] for more information.</p>
