<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is the <i>Bidi Brackets for Dummies</i> course.
When you finish this course, you will be able to identify
bracket pairs according to the Unicode Bidirectional
Algorithm (UBA for short). You will also be able to
add to your resume that you have completed the BFD course.</p>

<p>There are no real prerequisites for this course. You don't
even have to understand the concept of bidirectional text,
or why the UBA even exists. We'll just focus on what you need
to know to match up bracket pairs for rule N0 in the UBA.
(And no, that is not en oh "NO" &#x2014; it is en zero "N0".)</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter1"></a>Chapter 1. Brackets: What are they?</h2>

<p>So what is a "bracket", anyway?</p>

<p>&#x2014; Um, a "["?</p>

<p>Yes, correct. But actually, in the UBA, many other things
are also identified as "brackets". So a parenthesis "(" is
considered a bracket, and a curly brace "{" is also considered
a bracket. The "[" bracket is called a square bracket, so
we can tell it apart from all the other "brackets".</p>

<p>Basically, any of the punctuation marks that come in pairs,
and which are used to enclose stuff in text, to set it off
from other stuff outside the marks, are considered brackets.
There are many others, besides the ones people typically
recognize on their keyboard, including such oddities as
U+29FC &#x29FC; LEFT-POINTING CURVED ANGLE BRACKET and U+2E26 &#x2E26; LEFT SIDEWAYS U BRACKET.
There are even brackets in Unicode that aren't even called
brackets or parentheses or braces &#x2014; characters like
U+29DA &#x29DA; LEFT DOUBLE WIGGLY FENCE and U+27C5 &#x27C5; LEFT S-SHAPED BAG DELIMITER.
Don't ask me why &#x2014; they are all just a
bunch of weird squigglies used in pairs as punctuation.</p>

<p>&#x2014; I don't see any weird squigglies there. That's just a bunch of boxes!</p>

<p>Get yourself some better fonts.</p>

<p>&#x2014; So is the Arabic U+FDE3 &#xFDE3; ORNATE LEFT PARENTHESIS a bracket, too?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>&#x2014; Why not?</p>

<p>Because I said so.</p>

<p>&#x2014; How about quotation marks? They come in pairs and enclose stuff
inside, separating it from all the stuff outside. Some of them, like
that French thingie &#x2039; even look like brackets.</p>

<p>No, they aren't "brackets", either.</p>

<p>&#x2014; Why not?</p>

<p>Because I said so.</p>

<p>&#x2014; How about U+300C &#x300C; LEFT CORNER BRACKET? Is that a "bracket"?</p>

<p>Yes, that is a bracket.</p>

<p>&#x2014; But I thought that was a Japanese quotation mark. How come it
is a bracket, but the other quotation marks aren't?</p>

<p>Because I said so. Oh, and U+230A &#x230A; LEFT FLOOR is a "bracket", too.</p>

<p>&#x2014; But that doesn't make any sense. What does "FLOOR" have to do
with brackets?</p>

<p>It's probably something to do with maths, but it's a "bracket", anyway. Besides, if
you were a decent carpenter, you would know what a 
<a href="http://www.stadiumseatdepot.com/images/products/detail/SBrackets.jpg">floor bracket</a> was.</p>

<p>&#x2014; How about the left angle bracket "&lt;"? Is that at least a "bracket"?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>&#x2014; Why not?</p>

<p>Because it's a LESS-THAN SIGN. And enough with all these silly "Why?" and
"Why not?" questions.</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>

<p>Your homework is to memorize the list of
code points and character names in
BidiBrackets.txt [<a href="index.html#BidiBrackets">Brackets</a>]. That list defines all the brackets for UBA.
And it doesn't matter what else you might think is a "bracket".
That's the list and that's just the way it is.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2. Brackets: What are pairs?</h2>

<p>If you were paying attention in the Chapter 1 lesson, you may
have noticed that all the "brackets" had "LEFT" in their names.
It turns out, not too surprisingly, that there are also
corresponding "brackets" with "RIGHT" in their names.</p>

<p>The left and right versions of brackets form pairs with each
other. So "[" is the left version of "]", and vice versa.
They form a pair. And usually they are graphical mirrors of
each other. The left of the pair points right, and the right
of the pair points left.</p>

<p>&#x2014; Wait! That's too confusing.</p>

<p>O.k., think of it this way. The left of the pair occurs to
the left side of the text it encloses, and the right of the
pair occurs to the right side of the text it encloses. Is
that clearer?</p>

<p>&#x2014; Yes, much!</p>

<p>Only, sometimes in bidirectional text, it is just the opposite.</p>

<p>&#x2014; What?!</p>

<p>Well, don't worry about that now. Remember, you don't need to
understand bidirectional text to understand the identification
of bracket pairs. So forget I even mentioned that. The important
thing is to know that the "LEFT" ones pair with the "RIGHT"
ones, and it doesn't really matter, in the end, which way
they point or where the text they enclose actually is, o.k.?</p>

<p>&#x2014; Now wait a minute. I <i>did</i> my homework, and there was something
in that list called TIBETAN MARK GUG RTAGS GYON. That doesn't
have "LEFT" in its name. What's up with that?</p>

<p>Well, "GYON" <i>means</i> left in Tibetan. Same difference.</p>

<p>&#x2014; You can't fool me though &#x2014; I didn't see "LEFT" in OGHAM
FEATHER MARK, either. And you can't convince me that "FEATHER"
means left.</p>

<p>That one forms a pair with the OGHAM <i>REVERSED</i> FEATHER MARK. And you
know what they say about foolish consistency, right?</p>

<p>Anyway, the point is that all of the "brackets" come in pairs.
And even if they don't all actually have "LEFT" or "RIGHT" in
their names, you can always tell which one is paired with which
other one. If this isn't always obvious, then the way to figure
it out is to go back to BidiBrackets.txt. The <i>second</i> number
in each line of that file is the character that forms the pair.
So you look at a line like:</p>

<pre>005B; 005D; o # LEFT SQUARE BRACKET</pre>

<p>And that tells you that U+005D is the pair for U+005B LEFT SQUARE BRACKET.</p>

<p>The next line in the file is:</p>

<pre>005D; 005B; c # RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET</pre>

<p>And that tells you that U+005B is the pair for U+005D RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET.</p>

<p>&#x2014; But isn't that redundant? Why use two lines to tell me the same
thing?</p>

<p>Yes. And because if I tell you something two times, it is true.</p>

<p>&#x2014; Where did the "U+" come from? I don't see that in BidiBrackets.txt.</p>

<p>Go back to the <i>Unicode for Dummies</i> course.</p>

<p>So, for those of you who are still following along, the next thing
to know about is that the "LEFT" brackets in the pairs are also
known as "opening" and the "RIGHT" brackets in the pairs are also
known as "closing". The mysterious "o" and "c" that you see on
each line of BidiBrackets.txt stand for "o"pening and for "c"losing.
The "o" or "c" values are how you tell which one of a pair is
which, even if the characters don't actually have "LEFT" or
"RIGHT" in their names. It is really, really important, it turns
out, to know which is the opening one and which is the closing one,
because figuring out which particular bracket can pair up with which
particular other bracket in a long line of text depends 
on being able to find all the opening ones and all the closing ones.</p>

<p>But there is another complication here. It turns out that some
brackets are canonical equivalents of other brackets, and those
count as pairs, too.</p>

<p>&#x2014; Come again?</p>

<p>Well, according to the Unicode Normalization Algorithm, a few of
the angle brackets are canonically equivalent to other angle
brackets, and because canonical equivalents cannot really be
distinguished in most text processing, it isn't a good idea to
separate them when it comes to identifying bracket pairs.</p>

<p>&#x2014; Wait, I thought angle brackets weren't actually "brackets"!</p>

<p>Whatever. I'm not talking about "angle brackets" &#x2014; I'm talking
about U+2329 &#x2329; LEFT-POINTING ANGLE BRACKET and
U+3008 &#x3008; LEFT ANGLE BRACKET, which are the same as each
other, but which aren't the "&lt;" angle bracket you are thinking
about.</p>

<p>&#x2014; Ugh. I hated the <i>Unicode Normalization for Dummies</i> course &#x2014;
it was so confusing.</p>

<p>Well, you are right about that, at least! For now, just memorize
that U+3008 pairs with U+3009 and U+2329 pairs with U+232A,
but that U+3008 <i>also</i> pairs with U+232A and U+3009
<i>also</i> pairs with U+2329. It is just like having to know
that "pair" is also spelled "pear" &#x2014; only that the pairs we
are talking about here aren't pears, but angle brackets,
even though they aren't "angle brackets".</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>

<p>Your homework for this chapter is to go back to BidiBrackets.txt
[<a href="index.html#BidiBrackets">Brackets</a>]
and memorize all the "o" and "c" values in the list, so you
know which character in each pair is the opening or the closing one.</p>

<p>&#x2014; Will that be on the midterm?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3. Brackets: The syntax of pairing</h2>

<p>In Chapter 2 we learned all about which brackets pair with
which brackets. But it turns out that so far that information is all
abstract. We can think of that as the "semantics"
of bracket pairs, because it is the truth of their meaning,
independent of any use of them in text. An "opening bracket" is
opening, just because of what it is and what it means. It
doesn't matter where it occurs in text.</p>

<p>But determining which bracket pairs with which other bracket
is more complicated than just having memorized all the
information in BidiBrackets.txt and knowing which ones
are opening and which ones are closing.</p>

<p>So what am I talking about? Let's start by looking at
a few examples. In the following short text:</p>

<p>Voltage equals current multiplied by resistance (Ohm's Law)</p>

<p>The opening "(" is paired with the closing ")". And we
then interpret the text "Ohm's Law" as being "inside
the parentheses" &#x2014; or, more generally as "inside the
brackets", since we are talking generically about bracket
pairs here. Our concern is not the Chicago Manual of Style [<a href="http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn39/CMS">CMS</a>],
or exactly <i>which</i> brackets should be used where, but rather
just figuring out which <i>opening</i> bracket goes with which
<i>closing</i> bracket. It doesn't matter whether they are the right 
(or, um, "correct") ones or not. So for our purposes, it would 
be equally valid to consider:</p>

<p>Voltage equals current multiplied by resistance [Ohm's Law]</p>

<p>And see that the opening "[" is paired with the closing "]".</p>

<p>It is crucial, however, to note the exact order in which these
pairs occur. If the text is changed to:</p>

<p>Voltage equals current multiplied by resistance ]Ohm's Law[</p>

<p>We would no longer consider that particular "]" to be paired 
with that particular "[". They are in the wrong order here.
In principle, the closing "]" might pair with some opening "["
off the to the left of the line, but not visible here. And
the "[" might pair with some other "]" from somewhere continuing
on ahead in the text. But these two do not pair <i>with each other</i>,
because they appear here in the wrong order to be considered
a matching pair.</p>

<p>&#x2014; Wait! In this case, can't I just redefine "]" as opening
and "[" as closing? I kinda like the way "]Ohm's Law[" looks!</p>

<p>No. Well, maybe you could in an alternative universe, I suppose, but not
with the UBA we have. Remember, I told you to <i>memorize</i> the
opening and closing values in BidiBrackets.txt &#x2014; not to
<i>question</i> them.</p>

<p>At any rate, the point here is that for any <i>particular</i> bracket
in any <i>particular</i> text, it totally matters which order
you encounter them in. "(^.^)" contains a bracket pair &#x2014; well, it
might also contain an emoticon, but that is the topic for another course.
")^.^(", on the other hand, does <i>not</i> contain a bracket pair
(but might contain an Anpanman).</p>

<p>Also, if I have two lefts, as in "(^.^(", those two brackets
(well, <i>parentheses</i>, but whatever!) also do not
pair with each other. They <i>might</i> pair up with some closing
parentheses much later on in your text, but not with each other in
just the text as we have it there. Remember, the general principle
here is that two lefts do not make a right and two rights do
not make a left. :-) :-)</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>

<p>Your homework for this chapter is to meditate on the epistemological
implications of missing text and on <i>The Order of Things</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4. Brackets: Trial Runs</h2>

<p>Now that we have comes to grips with the fact that the order
of brackets matters, we need to move on to dealing with the
implications of more than two brackets occurring together.
When people use  multiple brackets altogether in a line,
whether they are individually matching pairs or not, how
do we figure out which <i>particular</i> bracket pairs up with
which <i>particular</i> other bracket?</p>

<p>In the case of just two brackets, this is pretty simple to
determine. But once the brackets start multiplying (with
or without multiplication signs), the situation gets exponentially
more complicated.</p>

<p>I'll start the discussion first using just sets of three
brackets, which I like to call "trials" &#x2014; because, after
all, they are sets of three, kinda like triads. But also because
we have to try various combinations to figure them out, and
because it is a trial to explain all this to you.</p>

<p>And before I go further, there is something <i>else</i> you need
to know. All of this work to match up brackets only counts
if you are inside a bidirectional "isolating run sequence". Those
are kinda like long distance training runs, only different.
If you don't know what they are, don't worry &#x2014; you can always
buy my two-part course, <i>Unicode Bidirectional Runs for Dummies</i>
and the sequel, <i>Unicode Bidirectional Isolating Run Sequences for
Dummies VI.III: The X10 Also Rises</i>.
For now, we'll just consider that somebody has already figured
out what they are, and all the examples here are inside a
single one of them, whatever they are.</p>

<p>So let's look at some examples. We'll stay simple
to start with and use brackets all of the same kind &#x2014; just square 
brackets.</p>

<p>Bud [Gus [Hank [Xerxes</p>

<p>O.k., there are three opening brackets in that line, but no
closing brackets. So there are no bracket pairs, which require
an opening bracket and a closing bracket in the correct order.
How about:</p>

<p>Bud ]Gus [Hank [Xerxes</p>

<p>Still three brackets, but now one is closing and two are opening.
They are still in the wrong order to make any pairs, however.
But look at:</p>

<p>Bud [Gus ]Hank [Xerxes</p>

<p>Now the first two brackets are opening and closing in the correct
order, so we can figure out that "[Gus ]" contains a bracket pair,
which, in turn encloses the text "Gus ", including the space.
The last opening bracket has no closing bracket to match with.
Similarly:</p>

<p>Bud ]Gus [Hank ]Xerxes</p>

<p>Now the first closing bracket has nothing to match, but "[Hank ]"
contains a bracket pair, enclosing the text "Hank ". Where things
start to get interesting is in the following:</p>

<p>Bud [Gus [Hank ]Xerxes</p>

<p>In this case "[Hank ]" still contains a bracket pair. The first
opening bracket on the line doesn't match the closing bracket,
because there is an opening bracket after it which is closer
to the closer. So the closer opener wins... wait, now I'm
confusing myself! In any case, the outside brackets in
"[Gus [Hank ]" don't match for a bracket pair &#x2014; only the
inside ones do.</p>

<p>Bud [Gus ]Hank ]Xerxes</p>

<p>That example is similar to the last one, only this time the
bracket pair is in "[Gus ]", and the second closing bracket
doesn't match any opening bracket.</p>

<p>Now let's throw a curveball in here &#x2014; in particular, a curly
brace. This changes things, and if you just swing away
without keeping your eye on the ball, you are going to miss
how things work:</p>

<p>Bud [Gus {Hank ]Xerxes</p>

<p>That example has the same pattern of opening-opening-closing,
but now the second opening bracket (the left curly brace)
no longer can match the closing bracket, because it is a
different kind of bracket. So in this case, the <i>outer</i>
pair matches, and we find a bracket pair in "[Gus {Hank ]",
enclosing the text "Gus {Hank ", including the left curly
brace, as well as the spaces.</p>

<p>As we'll see in the next chapter, the effect on that
curly brace is pretty drastic, because the bracket pair
(of square brackets) has taken square aim at and effectively 
snuffed the curly brace they enclose. That curly brace can't match 
any other curly brace which might have come later, because it 
has been enclosed already [in a {-coffin, as it were].</p>

<p>Be that as it may, remember that this behavior isn't
inherent to square brackets and curly braces. It isn't as if
square brackets are inherently "stronger" than curly braces
and always win when they come into contention for matching.
If the situation were reversed, the curly braces could turn
the tables and ice the bracket, instead:</p>

<p>Bud {Gus [Hank }Xerxes</p>

<p>In this case there is a "bracket" pair in "{Gus [Hank }",
enclosing the text "Gus [Hank ", including the left square
bracket, as well as the spaces. So here the curly braces
bury the single opening square bracket &#x2014; along
with Gus and Hank.</p>

<p>So as far as finding bracket pairs go, no single type of
"bracket" has priority over any other. They are all equals.
The important thing is which one comes first and then in what
order all the rest occur on the line.</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>

<p>Your homework is to try to dig up more triads with square brackets
and curly braces. If you find any "little problems" I have forgotten
about, it doesn't matter.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5. Brackets: Parsing and Multiple Brackets</h2>

<p>O.k., in the last chapter we move on to the most difficult
part of matching bracket pairs for UBA: what to do for
long sequences of multiple brackets of different types.
If you haven't washed out of the course by now, you might
have what it takes to join Unicode Bracket Club.</p>

<p>So what is the first rule of Unicode Bracket Club?</p>

<p>&#x2014; Um..., don't talk about brackets?</p>

<p>No. The first rule of Unicode Bracket Club is: Matching
bracket pairs for UBA is not expression evaluation.</p>

<p>&#x2014; Huh?</p>

<p>Well, yes. Most people's notion of how multiple parenthesis
matching works comes from their high school algebra class.
Remember those equations:</p>

<p align="center">((a + b) * (b + 9a)) + ((2a &#x2013; 1) * (2b + 17)) = &#x2013;1</p>

<p>You had to go through and evaluate all the expressions
and combine the inner expressions by applying the
operators to form other expressions, and so on.</p>

<p>And what happened if you were missing a balancing parenthesis?</p>

<p>&#x2014; Uh, the algebra teacher hit us with a ruler.</p>

<p>Right, and the equations didn't work, because they had what
is called an expression error. If you use parentheses
(or brackets for matrices, and so forth), they <i>have</i> to
balance, or the expression has a syntax error, and it cannot
be evaluated.</p>

<p>But in Unicode Bracket Club, if a "balancing parenthesis" is
missing, meh! It just changes what "bracket" matches what
other "bracket" in the line. And a missing match isn't an
error &#x2014; it's just "interesting".</p>

<p>So if you're all ready with your BNF for brackets and have
an LL-grammar ready and want to get busy with an LALR
parsing strategy for bidirectional brackets, you're probably
in the wrong class. Maybe <i>Compilers for Dummies</i> is what
you wanted.</p>

<p>Instead, in Unicode Bracket Club, we need to be able to
figure out what to do with:</p>

<pre><b>(((a[(])b</b></pre>

<p>We need to identify the matching bracket pairs and the brackets that
don't match, but always come out smiling. Because there are
no errors, and everyone is a winner in Unicode Bracket Club!</p>

<p>So how do we find matching bracket pairs? You already have
some clues from Chapter 4 and the earlier chapters:</p>

<p>1. An opener for a match has to come before its closer.</p>

<p>2. An opener for a match has to be the same <i>kind</i> of
bracket as its closer.</p>

<p>3. If an unmatched opener or closer ends up inside a
different matched pair, then it is erased from contention
and stays unmatched.</p>

<p>So let's extend the examples for bracket trials and move into
full-blown bracket matches. How can we describe the moves
which will lead to a good match?</p>

<p>First of all, always start from the left and move systematically
to the right. This is known as the logical order for a match.
(Members of Unicode Bracket Club living in the Middle East
tend to think of this as always starting from the right and
moving systematically to the left, but they are still using
the same logical order &#x2014; it just looks different when you
watch their matches. Think of it as watching from the
other side of the ring.)</p>

<p>Then take the following steps:</p>

<p>1. If you encounter a closer before you have any opener
to match it, just discard it. That is known as a feint.</p>

<p>2. If you encounter an opener, remember it. Those count
for scoring. Also remember what kind of opener it was and
exactly where you encountered it.</p>

<p>3. Move on.</p>

<p>4. If the next bracket you encounter is a closer, check
to see if it matches one of the openers you remembered.
You start from the most recently encountered opener and
think back to the first opener that is of the same type.
If you find one, congratulations, you have identified
a bracket pair. Mark it down for keeping. This is
known as a combination. And by the way, if you identified
a bracket pair, but while you were remembering back to
it, you passed over any brackets of <i>different</i> types,
whether opening or closing, you can now forget about
them. Those are all known as misses.</p>

<p>5. However, if the next bracket you encounter is <i>another</i>
opener, just remember it, too, and where you found it.
Those are known as keepers.</p>

<p>6. If the next character you encounter is not a bracket
at all, just skip on by. That is known as fancy footwork.</p>

<p>7. Now check if you have moved all the way systematically
in logical order to the end. If so, you are done, and it is time
for scoring. But if you aren't at the end, then go back
to step 3 and move on again. Remember to keep bobbing
and weaving as you continue the match.</p>

<p>Once the match is done, it is time for scoring. Bring all the
combinations you found to the scoring table and lay them
out for the judges to examine. The judges will then
reorder all the combinations by the positions they occurred
in. The number of combinations you found, reordered in
neat ascending order by position, constitute your score.
Congratulations!</p>

<p>O.k., let's watch the progress of a particular match closely,
to see all the moves one-by-one. The contender is:</p>

<pre><b>(((a[(])b
123456789</b></pre>

<p>Note that the positions are labeled, starting at 1, beneath
each character. We are going to work our way through,
systematically, in logical order, from 1 until we get all
the way to the end at 9.</p>

<p>Position 1: Found an opener "(". Remember it: "(" at 1.</p>

<p>Position 2: Found an opener "(". Remember it: "(" at 2.</p>

<p>Position 3: Found an opener "(". Remember it: "(" at 3.</p>

<p>Position 4: Not a bracket. Skip on by.</p>

<p>Position 5: Found an opener "[". Remember it: "[" at 5.</p>

<p>Position 6: Found an opener "(". Remember it: "(" at 6.</p>

<p>Position 7: Found a closer (finally!) "]". Think back to the first
matching opener before. That would be "[" at 5. Save
the combination: "[" at 5 and "]" at 7. And since we
passed over an unmatched opener "(" at 6, just forget
that one now. It is a miss.</p>

<p>Position 8: Found a closer ")". Think back to the first matching
opener before. Since we already forgot about "(" at 6,
the correct match will be "(" at 3. Save the combination:
"(" at 3 and ")" at 8.</p>

<p>Position 9: Not a bracket. Skip on by. But hey, we are at the end, so we're
done with this match.</p>

<p>Scoring:</p>

<p>Lay out the combinations you found:</p>

<p>"[" at 5 and "]" at 7<br>
"(" at 3 and ")" at 8</p>

<p>The judges rearrange those to:</p>

<p>"(" at 3 and ")" at 8<br>
"[" at 5 and "]" at 7</p>

<p>And count up your matches: your score is 2!</p>

<p>All the other brackets you found during the match don't count
for matching bracket pairs. They can be ignored from now on,
because you have your neatly arranged and scored list of
actual matched bracket pairs.</p>

<p>So lets go back to the start. The contender was:</p>

<pre><b>(((a[(])b</b></pre>

<p>And we have discovered that the <i>first</i> bracket pair in it
is "(a[(])", which encloses the text "a[(]".</p>

<p>But that enclosed text itself contains the <i>second</i> bracket
pair: "[(]", which encloses the text "(", itself an unmatched
"bracket".</p>

<p>And the two parentheses at the very start are also unmatched
"brackets".</p>

<p>So matched bracket pairs can be inside other matched bracket
pairs. We just have to be very careful in finding them, because
they aren't always immediately obvious. In particular, for
a different contender:</p>

<pre><b>[(])</b></pre>

<p>The "[(]" contains a matching bracket pair, but "(])" does not.</p>

<p>&#x2014; Well, I guess I understand sorta. But I've suffered all the way
through these explanations and I still don't know <i>what</i> a
matching bracket pair is when I see one. You've given me
instructions for how to join Unicode Bracket Club and then
find combinations that count as matched bracket pairs as I
step through all the moves to deal with a contender. Why
can't you just <i>define</i> what a goldarn matching bracket pair
<i>is</i>, instead of sending me through all this Bracket Club
folderol to try to find them??</p>

<p>Fair enough. I suppose we could try it that way.
First add a few definitions:</p>

<p><b>BD14.</b> An opening paired bracket is a character whose 
    Bidi_Paired_Bracket_Type property value is Open.</p>

<p><b>BD15.</b> A closing paired bracket is a character whose 
    Bidi_Paired_Bracket_Type property value is Close.</p>

<p><b>BD16a.</b>  A bracket pair is a pair of an opening paired bracket and a closing
    paired bracket character such that the Bidi_Paired_Bracket property 
    value of the former character or its canonical equivalent equals 
    the latter character or its canonical equivalent.</p>

<p>Note that you already memorized the list of those for your homework
for Chapter 2.</p>

<p><b>BD16b.</b>  A resolved bracket pair is a bracket pair that has been
    been selected from among possible bracket pairs in an isolating run
    sequence.</p>

<p>Now we've already agreed to ignore the fact that we don't
know exactly how to find an "isolating run sequence". And this
new term "resolved bracket pair" is just another way of saying
"a bracket pair which has been resolved by some selection
process to be a pair that matches". In other words, it means
a "matching bracket pair" in a syntactic context.</p>

<p>&#x2014; But that just gets me back to where I was before. I
know what "matching bracket pair" <i>means</i> &#x2014; I just don't
know how to find the darn things! Now you're just saying
they are "selected from among possible bracket pairs". How
do I find them?</p>

<p>Relax, relax. The answer to that is coming. We'll just define
a rule to select them:</p>

<p><b>Rx.</b>  For each isolating run sequence, bracket characters are selected
    into resolved bracket pairs as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting at the beginning of the run sequence, when a closing
    bracket character is encountered, find the nearest preceding
    opening character that forms a bracket pair, but is not already
    part of a resolved bracket pair, and not ignored for bracket pair
    selection.</p>

<p>If one exists, resolve the pair, and mark any enclosed
    opening brackets of any kind as not part of a bracket pair and
    ignored for further bracket pair selection. Otherwise, if no pair
    can be selected, mark the closing bracket as not part of a pair
    and ignored for further pair selection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x2014; Gah! That's it?! How is that any clearer than the rules for
Unicode Bracket Club matches? Can you show me how that works?</p>

<p>Sure. Let's go back to our original contender:</p>

<pre><b>(((a[(])b
123456789</b></pre>

<p>Let's use Rule Rx and select all the resolved bracket pairs.</p>

<p>1. Scan forward to the first closing bracket character.
That is "]" at 7.</p>

<p>2. Scan backwards to the nearest opening bracket character that
forms a bracket pair. That is "[" at 5.</p>

<p>3. Is "[" at 5 already part of a resolved bracket pair?
(Oops! Reminder to self: remember to first scan through and
set all brackets to "not-in-resolved-bracket-pair" before
starting to apply Rx.) Let's go with the answer: No.</p>

<p>4. Is "[" at 5 not ignored for bracket pair selection?
(Oops! Reminder to self: remember to first scan through and
set all brackets to "not-ignored-for-bracket-selection" before
starting to apply Rx.) Let's go with the answer: No.</p>

<p>5. O.k., we've determined that "[" at 5 meets the criterion,
so we now have our first resolved bracket pair. Set "[" at 5
and "]" at 7 to "in-resolved-bracket-pair".</p>

<p>6. Find any enclosed opening bracket in the resolved bracket
pair. That means scanning between 5 and 7. We find "(" at 6.
Mark that as "not-in-resolved-bracket-pair" and
"ignored-for-bracket-selection".</p>

<p>7. Go back to where we left off at step #1 and scan forward
to the next closing bracket character. That is ")" at 8.</p>

<p>8. Scan backwards to the nearest opening bracket character
that forms a bracket pair. That is "(" at 6.</p>

<p>9. Is "(" at 6 part of a resolved bracket pair? No.</p>

<p>10. Is "(" at 6 ignored for bracket pair selection? Yes.
O.k., then we need to keep scanning back.</p>

<p>11. Scan backwards to the next nearest opening bracket character
that forms a bracket pair. That is "(" at 3.</p>

<p>12. Is "(" at 3 part of a resolved bracket pair? No.</p>

<p>13. Is "(" at 3 ignored for bracket pair selection? No.</p>

<p>14. O.k., we've determined that "(" at 3 meets the criterion,
so we now have our second resolved bracket pair. Set "(" at 3
and ")" at 8 to "in-resolved-bracket-pair".</p>

<p>15. Find any enclosed opening bracket in the resolved bracket
pair. That means scanning between 3 and 8. We find "[" at 5 and (" at 6.
Mark them as "not-in-resolved-bracket-pair" and as
"ignored-for-bracket-selection". (Oops! Reminder to self: Update
rule Rx, because we really didn't want to change "[" at 5
to "not-in-resolved-bracket-pair" and "ignored-for-bracket-selection".
For now, we'll just pretend the rule is already patched up.)</p>

<p>16. Go back to where we left off at step #7 and scan forward
to the next closing bracket character. O.k., there aren't any.
We are done.</p>

<p>Now we can go on to scoring.</p>

<p>What are all the brackets identified as "in-resolved-bracket-pair"?
Those would be:</p>

<p>"(" at 3, "[" at 5, "]" at 7, and ")" at 8</p>

<p>But what are the actual resolved pairs? Oops! We forgot to keep track.
Reminder to self: Add requirement in rule to keep exact list of
each resolved bracket pair as it is identified, for later reference.</p>

<p>O.k., let's go back and keep track as we resolve them, and we get:</p>

<p>"[" at 5 and "]" at 7<br>
"(" at 3 and ")" at 8</p>

<p>That's two resolved bracket pairs, so our final score is 2!</p>

<p>We're done, right? Oops! We forgot to reorder the list in ascending
order by position, rather than in order of selection by rule Rx.
Reminder to self: Add requirement in rule to do post-selection
reordering by position of the first character in each resolved
bracket pair in the list.</p>

<p>Well, there were a few things that needed patching up here and there, but
the process of selection is ever so much clearer expressed this
way, right? We don't have to "remember" a stack of openers.
All we have to "remember" is the process status of all the
brackets, where we left off to restart the forward scan,
the spans we have to check (and recheck) each time we identify
a new resolved bracket pair, and the list of resolved bracket
pairs as we select them.</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>

<p>Find the bracket pairs in this new contender: </p>

<pre><b>({([{([){()([])]}}[{(X)})[)])})}}{([])[]})</b></pre>

<p>For extra credit do the exercise twice, once with each method
described here, and compare and contrast your results.</p>
