 <h2>1 <a name="GDP_by_Language">GDP by Language</a></h2>

 <p>Many people in the software industry don't realize how important it is
to localize products for different languages around the world. While English
is a major language, it only accounts for around 30% of the world Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), and is likely to account for less in the future. Neglecting
other languages means ignoring quite significant potential markets.</p>
<p>This short article provides one picture of the economic significance of
different languages, with a breakdown of the percentages of world GDP by
language. Not only does it show the current breakdown, but it also provides
data for the years 1975 to 2002 to show modern trends. The most notable feature
is the steady rise of Chinese and slow relative decline of Japanese and most
European languages. Korean and Indic languages also show growth over that
period, though slower than Chinese.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 1: GDP by Language 1975-2002</b></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="fig1-gdp-ppp-by-lang.gif" width="848" height="536"></p>
<p>The GDP values are expressed in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP),
which accounts for price differences between countries; for more about PPP,
see [<a href="index.html#WorldBank">WorldBank</a>].</p>
<p>The <i>Other</i> field is the accumulated total for languages for which
there is data, but where each has less than 0.9% of the world GDP. It is
provided below. While each language separately corresponds to a small percentage,
their total is significant (about the same as Chinese). In general, the data
is less reliable for smaller languages, so the order should not be taken
as significant.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Tagalog, Afrikaans, Persian, Swedish, Ukrainian, Malay,
Telugu, Greek, Marathi, Tamil, Vietnamese, Cantonese, Urdu, Norwegian, Danish,
Czech, Hebrew, Catalan, Romanian,   Hungarian, Gujarati, Finnish, Turkic,
Punjabi, Kannada, Other Indic, Malayalam, Oriya, Slovak, Galician, Bulgarian,
Byelorussian, Croatian, Amharic, Sindhi, Sinhalese, Assamese,   Nepali, Kurdish,
Kazakh, Uzbek, Slovenian, Pashto (Pushto), Luxembourgish, Azerbaijani, Latvian
(Lettish), Cambodian, Turkmen, Basque, Estonian, Albanian, Balochi, Malagasy, 
  Lithuanian, Armenian, Kinyarwanda, Swahili, Laothian, Macedonian, Icelandic,
Luri, Georgian, Serbian, Tajik, Hindko, Moldavian, Konkani, Sesotho, Mongolian,
Manipuri, Kirghiz,   Maltese, Brahui, Chichewa, Croatian, Kirundi, Afar,
Rhaeto-Romance, Samoan, Tonga,...</p>

<p>Ideally, one would determine the proportion of world GDP allocated to
each person in the world, and apportion that to different languages on the
basis of the languages that person speaks during average working hours. One
can approximate that process with the available data: GDP for countries and
proportions of language speakers in each country.</p>
<p>The GDP data for different countries comes from the World Bank [<a href="index.html#WorldBank">WorldBank</a>].
Where data is missing for a given year, it is interpolated on the basis of 
the percentage of world GDP before and/or after the missing year (all of
these are for countries with relatively small GDPs, so they don't materially
affect the data for the top languages shown above).</p>
<p>The assignment of GDP to languages is based on the percentage of language speakers within each country. 
This was based on the [<a href="index.html#Factbook">Factbook</a>] where it had
available data, and supplemented with other sources such as [<a href="index.html#CensusIndia">CensusIndia</a>] or 
[<a href="index.html#Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a>] where it did not. For example, the
GDP of India is split as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hindi 40.22% Bengali 8.30% Telugu 7.87% Marathi 7.45% Tamil 6.32% Urdu 5.18% Gujarati 4.85% Kannada 3.90%...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apportionment by speakers is clearly an approximation, since it is unlikely
that economic activity would be evenly distributed by language. Multinational
companies that contribute significantly to the economy may use a different
working company language; for example, the working language of the Finnish
company Nokia is English. In particular, the economic activity ascribed to
English is probably somewhat low, because of the leading role it plays in
global commerce as a second language. It is not, for example, listed in [<a href="index.html#CensusIndia">CensusIndia</a>] 
even though it clearly plays a key economic role in India. Similarly, French
plays an important role in the Maghreb countries (both in business and government),
as does Russian in former-USSR countries.</p>
<p>Yet despite these caveats, the information is accurate enough that the
above chart can give an overall picture of the relative levels of economic
activity in different languages, and their growth over time.</p>
<h2>3 <a name="Projections">Projections</a></h2>
<p>An interesting recent paper from Goldman Sachs [<a href="index.html#Brics2050">Brics2050</a>]
does project that the combined GDP of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia,
India, and China) will exceed that of the current G6 (United States, Japan,
Germany, France, United Kingdom, and Italy) before the year 2050. The following
chart uses that data to extrapolate what the <i>GDP by Language</i> breakdown would be over the coming years. Chinese
would have increasing weight, as in the following chart; Russian, Portuguese,
and Indic would all increase as well, but most significantly after 2010.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Caution: </b>this data is much more speculative:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Because [<a href="index.html#Brics2050">Brics2050</a>]  doesn't have data for languages outside of the BRIC and G6 
    countries, the values for those languages are interpolated.</li>
    <li>The data from [<a href="index.html#Brics2050">Brics2050</a>] is in constant dollars, not PPP. Because internal costs will 
    presumably rise with growth, this would cause the projected
      PPP of a high-growth country like China to be overstated in the chart.</li>
    <li>Because of these issues with the data, the chart only covers the next few years, not all the way out to 2050.</li>
  </ul>
