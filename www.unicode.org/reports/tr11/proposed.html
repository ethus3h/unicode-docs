  <h2>1 <a name="Overview" href="proposed.html#Overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>When dealing with East Asian text, there is the concept of an <i>inherent</i> 
width of a character. This width takes on either of two values: <i>narrow</i> or
<i>wide.</i> For traditional mixed-width East Asian legacy character sets, this classification into
narrow and wide corresponds with few exceptions directly to the storage size for each
character: a few narrow characters use a single byte per character and all other
characters (usually wide) use two or more bytes.</p>
	<p>Layout and line breaking (to cite only two examples) in East 
Asian context show systematic variations depending on the value of this East_Asian_Width property. <i>Wide</i> characters  behave like ideographs; they tend to allow 
line breaks after each character and remain upright in vertical text layout. 
<i>Narrow</i> characters are kept together in words or runs that are rotated 
sideways in vertical text layout.</p>
	<p>For a traditional East Asian <i>fixed pitch</i> font, this width
  translates to a display width of either one half or a whole unit width. A
  common name for this unit width is &#x201C;Em&#x201D;. While 
  an Em is   customarily the <i>height</i>  of the letter &#x201C;M&#x201D;,  
  it is the same as the unit <i>width</i> in East 
  Asian fonts, because in these fonts  the standard character cell  is square.
  In contrast, the character width for a fixed-pitch Latin font
    like Courier is generally 3/5 of an Em.</p>
    <p>In modern practice, most alphabetic characters
    are rendered by variable-width fonts using narrow characters, even if their
    encoding in common legacy sets uses multiple
    bytes. In contrast, emoji characters
    were first developed through the use of extensions of legacy East
    Asian encodings, such as Shift-JIS, and in such a context they
    were treated as wide characters. While these extensions have been
    added to Unicode or mapped to standardized variation sequences,
    their treatment as wide characters has been retained, and
    extended for consistency with emoji characters that lack a legacy
    encoding.</p>
    
  <p>Except for a few characters, which are explicitly
  called out as <i>fullwidth</i> or <i>halfwidth</i> in the Unicode Standard, 
	characters are not duplicated based on distinction in width. 
  Some characters,  such as the ideographs, are always wide; others are always 
	narrow; and some
  can be narrow or wide, depending on the context. The Unicode character 
	property
  <i>East_Asian_Width</i> provides a default classification of characters, which an
  implementation can use to decide at runtime whether to treat a character
  as narrow or wide.</p>

<p>The East_Asian_Width property does not
preserve canonical equivalence, because the base characters of
canonical decompositions almost always have a different
East_Asian_Width than the precomposed characters. Decomposing a
character, and applying the East_Asian_Width to a base character and
combining marks separately does not yield the expected values. For
examples, see Section 4, <a href="proposed.html#Definitions"><i>Definitions</i></a>.</p>

  <h2>2 <a name="Scope" href="proposed.html#Scope">Scope</a></h2>
  <p>The East_Asian_Width is an informative property and provides a useful 
	concept for implementations that</p><ul>
    <li>Have to interwork with East Asian legacy character encodings</li>
    <li>Support both East Asian and Western typography and line layout</li>
    <li>Need to associate fonts with unmarked text runs containing East Asian characters</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This annex gives general guidelines how to use this property. It
does not provide rules or specifications of how this property might be
used in font design or line layout, because, while a useful property
for this purpose, it is only one of several character properties that
would need to be considered. While
the specific assignments of property values for given
characters may change over time, it is
generally not intended to reflect evolving practice for existing characters. In particular some
alphabetic and symbol characters are treated as wide in certain East
Asian legacy character set implementations, and as narrow in all other
cases. Instead, the guidelines on use of this property should
be considered recommendations based on a
particular legacy practice that may be overridden by
implementations as necessary.</p>


  <h2>3 <a name="Description" href="proposed.html#Description">Description</a></h2>
  <p>By convention, 1/2 Em wide characters of East Asian legacy encodings are
  called &#x201C;halfwidth&#x201D; (or <i>hankaku</i> characters in Japanese);
  the others are called correspondingly &#x201C;fullwidth&#x201D; (or <i>zenkaku</i>)
  characters. Legacy encodings often use a single byte for the halfwidth
  characters and two bytes for the fullwidth characters. In the Unicode
  Standard, no such distinction is made, but understanding the distinction is
  often necessary when interchanging data with legacy systems, especially when
  fixed-size buffers are involved.</p>
  <p>Some character blocks in the compatibility zone contain characters that are
  explicitly marked &#x201C;halfwidth&#x201D; and &#x201C;fullwidth&#x201D; in their
  character name, but for all other characters the width property must be
  implicitly derived. Some characters behave differently in an East Asian context
  than in a non-East Asian context. Their default width property is considered
  ambiguous and needs to be resolved into an actual width property based on
  context.</p>
  <p>The Unicode Character Database [<a href="../tr41/tr41-19.html#UCD">UCD</a>] assigns to each
  Unicode character as its default width property one of six values: <i>Ambiguous, Fullwidth, Halfwidth,
  Narrow, Wide</i>, or <i>Neutral</i> (<i>= Not East Asian</i>). For any given operation, these six default property
  values resolve into only two property values, <i>narrow </i>and <i>wide, </i>depending
  on context.</p>

  Asian legacy character encodings and implementing East Asian typography, East_Asian_Width is a categorization of character. It can take on two abstract values, <i>narrow</i> and <i>wide</i>.</p>
	<p>In legacy
  implementations, there is often a corresponding difference in encoding length
  (one or two bytes) as well as a difference in displayed width. However, the <i>actual</i>
  display width of a glyph is given by the font and may be further adjusted by
  layout. An important class of fixed-width legacy fonts contains glyphs of just
  two widths, with the wider glyphs twice as wide as the narrower glyphs.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><b>Note:</b> Unlike U+00A5 &#x00A5; YEN SIGN, U+20A9 &#x20A9; WON SIGN has an explicit East Asian Width property of <i>East Asian Halfwidth</i> (H). What makes U+00A5 different is that this character was included in a very common&mdash;and non&ndash;East Asian&mdash;character set standard, specifically ISO/IEC 8859-1, and encoded at 0xA5. Almost all legacy Latin fonts supported ISO/IEC 8859-1 in its entirety, using variable-width glyphs. By contrast, most legacy font implementations used an explicit half-width glyph for the won sign, whose source is the standard KS X 1003, and encoded at 0x5C. The assignment of the <i>East Asian Halfwidth</i> (H) property does not preclude font developers from using a variable-width glyph for U+20A9, and doing so has become a common practice.</p>

  where they are wide characters (such as the Unified Han Ideographs or Squared
  Katakana Symbols). This category includes characters that have explicit

  narrow and&nbsp;have explicit fullwidth or wide counterparts. These

  sets because they have explicit fullwidth or wide counterparts. All of ASCII is
  an example of East Asian Narrow characters.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is useful to distinguish characters explicitly defined as halfwidth

    <p>Ambiguous characters occur in East Asian legacy character sets as <i>wide</i>
    characters, but as <i>narrow</i> (i.e., normal-width) characters in
    non-East Asian usage. (Examples are the basic Greek and Cyrillic alphabet found in
    East Asian character sets, but also some of the mathematical symbols.)
    Private-use characters are considered ambiguous by 
    default, because additional
    information is required to know whether they should be treated as wide or
    narrow.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>When they are treated as <i>wide</i> characters, ambiguous characters
    would typically be rendered upright in vertical text runs.</p>

  they also do not occur in East Asian typography. For example, there is
  no traditional Japanese way of typesetting Devanagari. Canonical equivalents of narrow and neutral characters may
not themselves be narrow or neutral respectively. For
  example, U+00C5 &#x00C5;
  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE is 
	Neutral, but its decomposition starts with a Narrow character.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Strictly speaking, it makes no sense to talk of narrow and wide for
    neutral characters, but because for all practical purposes they behave like
    Na, they are treated as narrow characters (the same as Na) under the
    recommendations below. </p>

  <h3>4.1 <a name="Relation" href="proposed.html#Relation">Relation to the Terms &#x201C;Fullwidth&#x201D; and
  &#x201C;Halfwidth&#x201D;</a></h3>
  <p>When converting a DBCS mixed-width encoding to and from Unicode, the
  fullwidth characters in such a mixed-width encoding are mapped to the
  fullwidth compatibility characters in the FFxx block, whereas the
  corresponding halfwidth characters are mapped to ordinary Unicode characters
  (for example, ASCII in U+0021..U+007E, plus a few other scattered characters).</p>
  <p>In the context of interoperability with DBCS character encodings, this
  restricted set of Unicode characters in the General Scripts area can be
  construed as halfwidth, rather than fullwidth. (This applies only to the
  restricted set of characters that can be paired with the fullwidth
  compatibility characters.)</p>
  <p>In the context of interoperability with DBCS character encodings, all other
  Unicode characters that are not explicitly marked as halfwidth can be
  construed as fullwidth.</p>
  <p>In any other context, Unicode characters not explicitly marked as being
  either fullwidth or halfwidth compatibility forms are neither halfwidth nor
  fullwidth.</p>
  <p>Seen in this light, the &#x201C;halfwidth&#x201D; and &#x201C;fullwidth&#x201D;
  properties are not unitary character properties in the same sense as
  &#x201C;space&#x201D; or &#x201C;combining&#x201D; or &#x201C;alphabetic.&#x201D; They
  are, instead, relational properties of a pair of characters, one of which is
  explicitly encoded as a halfwidth or fullwidth form for compatibility in
  mapping to DBCS mixed-width character encodings.</p>
  <p>What is &#x201C;fullwidth&#x201D; by default today could in theory become
  &#x201C;halfwidth&#x201D; tomorrow by the introduction of another character on
  the SBCS part of a mixed-width code page somewhere, requiring the introduction
  of another fullwidth compatibility character to complete the mapping.
  However, because the single byte part of mixed-width character sets is limited,
  there are not going to be many candidates and neither the Unicode Technical
  Committee [<a href="../tr41/tr41-19.html#UTC">UTC</a>] nor WG2 has any intention to 
	encode
  additional compatibility characters for this purpose.</p>
  <h3>4.2 <a name="Ambiguous" href="proposed.html#Ambiguous">Ambiguous Characters</a></h3>
  <p>Ambiguous width characters are all those characters that can occur as 
	fullwidth characters in any of a number of East Asian legacy character 
	encodings. They have a &#x201C;resolved&#x201D; width of either narrow or wide depending on
  the context of their use. If they are not used in the context of the specific
  legacy encoding to which they belong, their width resolves to narrow. Otherwise, it
  resolves to fullwidth or halfwidth. The term <i>context</i> as used here
  includes extra information such as explicit markup, knowledge of the source
  code page, font information, or language and script identification. For
  example:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Greek characters resolve to narrow when used with a standard Greek font,&nbsp; 
	because there is no East Asian legacy context.</li>
    <li>Private-use character codes and the replacement character have ambiguous
      width, because they may stand in for characters of any width.</li>
    <li>Ambiguous quotation marks are generally resolved to wide when they
      enclose and are adjacent to a wide character, and to narrow otherwise.</li>
  </ul>

<p>The East_Asian_Width property does not
preserve canonical equivalence, because the base characters of
canonical decompositions almost always have a different
East_Asian_Width than the precomposed characters.  East Asian Width is
designed for use with legacy character sets so the property value is
not designed to respect canonical equivalence.  </p>



  <p><i><b>Modern Rendering Practice.</b></i> Modern practice is evolving toward rendering ever more of the
  ambiguous characters with proportionally spaced, narrow forms that rotate with
  the direction of writing, making a distinction within the 
	legacy character set. In
  other words, context information beyond the choice of font or source character
  set is employed to resolve the width of the character. This annex does not
  attempt to track such changes in practice; therefore, the set of characters with mappings to legacy character sets 
  that have been assigned ambiguous width constitute a superset of the set of
  such characters that may be rendered as 
  wide characters in a given context. In 
  particular, an application might find it useful to treat characters from alphabetic scripts as narrow by default.
  Conversely, many of the symbols in the Unicode Standard have 
	no mappings
  to legacy character sets, yet they may be rendered as &#x201C;wide&#x201D; characters if they appear
  in an East Asian context. An implementation might therefore elect to treat them as ambiguous
 even though they are classified as <i>neutral</i> here.</p>

    <li>Narrow characters behave like Western characters, for example, in line
      breaking. They are rotated sideways, when appearing in vertical text. In
      fixed-pitch East Asian fonts, they take up 1/2 Em of space, but in
      rendering, a non-East Asian, proportional font is often substituted.</li>
    <li>Ambiguous characters behave like wide or narrow characters depending on
      the context (language tag, script identification, associated font, source of
      data, or explicit markup; all can provide the context). 
      If the context cannot be established reliably, they should be treated as
      narrow characters by default.</li>

  </ul>
  <h2>6 <a name="Classifications" href="proposed.html#Classifications">Classifications</a></h2>
  <p>The classifications presented here are based on the most widely used
  mixed-width legacy character sets in use in East Asia as of this writing. In
  particular, the assignments of the Neutral or Ambiguous
  categories depend on the contents of these character sets. For example, an
  implementation that knows <i>a priori</i> that it needs to interchange
  data <i>only</i> with the Japanese Shift-JIS character set, but not with other East Asian
  character sets, could reduce the number of characters in the Ambiguous
  classification to those actually encoded in Shift-JIS. Alternatively, such a reduction
  could be done implicitly at runtime in the context of interoperating with
  Shift-JIS fonts or data sources. Conversely, if additional character sets are
  created and widely adopted for legacy purposes, more characters would need to
  be classified as ambiguous.</p>

  <h3>6.1 <a name="Unassigned" href="proposed.html#Unassigned">Unassigned and Private-Use Characters</a></h3>


  <p>All private-use characters are by default classified as Ambiguous, 
	because their definition depends on context.</p>

  <p>Unassigned code points in ranges intended for CJK ideographs are classified as Wide. Those ranges are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the CJK Unified Ideographs block, 4E00..9FFF</li>
<li>the CJK Unified Ideographs Externsion A block, 3400..4DBF</li>
<li>the CJK Compatibility Ideographs block, F900..FAFF</li>
<li>the Supplementary Ideographic Plane, 20000..2FFFF</li>
<li>the Tertiary Ideographic Plane, 30000..3FFFF</li>
</ul>


<p>All other unassigned code points are 
	by default classified as Neutral.</p> 




<p>For additional recommendations for handling the default property value for
  unassigned characters, see <i>Section 5.3</i>,<i> Unknown and Missing Characters,</i> 
	in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-19.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>

  <h3>6.2 <a name="Combining" href="proposed.html#Combining">Combining Marks</a></h3>
  <p>Combining marks have been classified and are given a property assignment
  based on their typical applicability. For example, combining marks typically
  applied to characters of class <strong>N</strong>, <strong>Na</strong>, or <strong>W</strong>
  are classified as <strong>A</strong>. Combining marks for purely non-East
  Asian scripts are marked as <strong>N</strong>, and nonspacing marks used
  only with wide characters are given a <strong>W</strong>. Even more so than
  for other characters, the East_Asian_Width property for combining
  marks is not the same as their display width.</p>
  <p>In particular, nonspacing marks do not possess actual advance width.
  Therefore, even when displaying combining marks, the East_Asian_Width property
  cannot be related to the advance width of these characters. However, it can be
  useful in determining the encoding length in a legacy encoding, or the choice
  of font for the range of characters including that nonspacing mark. The width
  of the glyph image of a nonspacing mark should always be chosen as the
  appropriate one for the width of the base character.</p>

  <h3>6.3 <a name="DataFile" href="proposed.html#DataFile">Data File</a></h3>
  <p>The East_Asian_Width classification of all Unicode characters 
  is listed in the file EastAsianWidth.txt [<a href="../tr41/tr41-19.html#Data11">Data11</a>] in the 
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/ucd/">Unicode
  Character Database</a> [<a href="../tr41/tr41-19.html#UCD">UCD</a>]. This is a tab-delimited, two-column, 
  plain text file, with code position and East_Asian_Width designator.
  A comment at the end of each line indicates the character name. Ideographic,
  Hangul, Surrogate, and Private Use ranges are collapsed by giving a range in
  the first column.</p>

  <h3>6.4 <a name="Adding" href="proposed.html#Adding">Adding Characters</a></h3>
  <p>As more characters are added to the Unicode Standard, or if additional
  character sets are created and widely adopted for legacy purposes, the
  assignment of East_Asian_Width may be changed for some characters.
  Implementations should not make any assumptions to the contrary. The sets of Narrow, Fullwidth, and
  Halfwidth characters are fixed for all practical purposes. New characters for most
  scripts will be Neutral characters; however, characters for East Asian scripts
  using wide characters will be classified as Wide.
  Symbol characters that are, or are expected to be, used both as wide characters
  in East Asian usage and as narrow characters in non-East Asian usage will be classified Ambiguous.</p>
