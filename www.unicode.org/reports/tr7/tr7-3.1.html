<h2><a name="Scope"></a>1 Scope</h2>
The Plane 14 technical report addresses the recurrent and persistent call for a 
lighter-weight mechanism for text tagging than typical text markup mechanisms in 
Unicode. It proposes a special set of characters used <i>only</i> for tagging. 
These tag characters can be embedded into plain text and can be identified 
and/or ignored with trivial algorithms, since there is no overloading of usage 
for these tag characters--they can only express tag values and never textual 
content itself.
<h2><a name="Description"></a>2 Description</h2>
This technical report addresses the need for a mechanism for generic tagging in 
Unicode plain text. A set of special-use tag characters on Plane 14 of ISO/IEC 
10646 (accessible through UTF-8, UTF-16, and UCS-4 encoding forms) are proposed 
for encoding to enable the spelling out of ASCII-based string tags using 
characters which can be strictly separated from ordinary text content characters 
in 10646 (or Unicode).
<p>One tag identification character and one cancel tag character are also 
proposed. In particular, a language tag identification character is proposed to 
identify a language tag string specifically; the language tag itself makes use 
of RFC 1766 language tag strings spelled out using the Plane 14 tag characters. 
Provision of a specific, low-overhead mechanism for embedding language tags in 
plain text is aimed at meeting the need of Internet protocols such as ACAP, 
which require a standard mechanism for marking language in UTF-8 strings.
<h2><a name="Definitions"></a>3 Definitions</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><i>All terms not defined here shall be as defined in the Unicode Standard.</i></dt>
</dl>
No attempt is made to define all terms used in this document. However, four 
terms which are used in special senses here require some clarification.
<p><i>Tagging</i> - The association of attributes of text with a point or range 
of the primary text. (The value of a particular tag is not generally considered 
to be a part of the &quot;content&quot; of the text. Typical examples of tagging 
is to mark language or font of a portion of text.)
<p><i>Annotation</i> - The association of secondary textual content with a point 
or range of the primary text. (The value of a particular annotation <i>is </i>considered 
to be a part of the &quot;content&quot; of the text. Typical examples include 
glossing, citations,exemplification,Japanese yomi, etc.)
<p><i>Out-of-band</i> - An out-of-band channel conveys a tag in such a way that 
the textual content, as encoded, is completely untouched and unmodified. This is 
typically done by metadata or hyperstructure of some sort.
<p><i>In-band</i> - An in-band channel conveys a tag along with the textual 
content, using the same basic encoding mechanism as the text itself. This is 
done by various means, but an obvious example is SGML markup, where the tags are 
encoded in the same character set as the text and are interspersed with and 
carried along with the text data.
<h2><a name="Specifications"></a>4 Specifications</h2>
<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>4.1 Introduction</h3>
There has been much discussion over the last 8 years of language tagging and of 
other kinds of tagging of Unicode plain text. It is fair to say that there is 
more-or-less universal agreement that language tagging of Unicode plain text is 
required for certain textual processes. For example, language 
&quot;hinting&quot; of multilingual text is necessary for multilingual 
spell-checking based on multiple dictionaries to work well. Language tagging 
provides a minimum level of required information for text-to-speech processes to 
work correctly. Language tagging is regularly done on web pages, to enable 
selection of alternate content, for example.
<p>However, there has been a great deal of controversy regarding the appropriate 
placement of language tags. Some have held that the only appropriate placement 
of language tags (or other kinds of tags) is out-of-band, making use of 
attributed text structures or metadata. Others have argued that there are 
requirements for lower-complexity in-band mechanisms for language tags (or other 
tags) in plain text.
<p>The controversy has been muddied by the existence and widespread use of a 
number of in-band text markup mechanisms (HTML, text/enriched, etc.) which 
enable language tagging, but which imply the use of general parsing mechanisms 
which are deemed too &quot;heavyweight&quot; for protocol developers and a 
number of other applications. The difficulty of using general in-band text 
markup for simple protocols derives from the fact that some characters are used 
both for textual content and for the text markup; this makes it more difficult 
to write simple, fast algorithms to find only the textual content and ignore the 
tags, or vice versa. (Think of this as the algorithmic equivalent of the 
difficulty the human reader has attempting to read just the content of raw HTML 
source text without a browser interpreting all the markup tags.)
<p>The Plane 14 technical report addresses the recurrent and persistent call for 
a lighter-weight mechanism for text tagging than typical text markup mechanisms 
in Unicode. It proposes a special set of characters used <i>only</i> for 
tagging. These tag characters can be embedded into plain text and can be 
identified and/or ignored with trivial algorithms, since there is no overloading 
of usage for these tag characters--they can only express tag values and never 
textual content itself.
<p>Tag characters are not intended for general annotation of text.
<p>This report is the result of an intense email discussion regarding language 
tagging and related issues, occasioned by the review of 
draft-ietf-acap-mlsf-01.txt and of draft-ietf-acap-langtag-00.txt, which 
proposed different mechanisms for language tagging in plain text. The Plane 14 
technical report represents the consensus of a meeting of the UTC Working Group 
on Tagging and Annotation and of IETF representatives which took place on June 
24,1997.
<h3><a name="Basic Proposal"></a>4.2 Basic Proposal</h3>
This technical report suggests the use of 95 dedicated tag characters, 
comprising a clone of 7-bit ASCII, plus a language tag character and a cancel 
tag, for a total of 97 characters, encoded at the start of Plane 14 of ISO/IEC 
10646.
<p>These tag characters are to be used to spell out any ASCII- based tagging 
scheme which needs to be embedded in Unicode plain text. In particular, they can 
be used to spell out language tags in order to meet the expressed requirements 
of the ACAP protocol and the likely requirements of other new protocols 
following the guidelines of the IAB character workshop (RFC 2130).
<p>The suggested range in Plane 14 for the block reserved for tag characters is 
as follows, expressed in each of the three most generally used encoding schemes 
for ISO/IEC 10646:
<p>UCS-4
<p>U-000E0000 .. U-000E007F
<p>UTF-16
<p>U+DB40 U+DC00 .. U+DB40 U+DC7F
<p>UTF-8
<p>0xF3 0xA0 0x80 0x80 .. 0xF3 0xA0 0x81 0xBF
<p>Of this range, U-000E0020 .. U-000E007E is the suggested range for the ASCII 
clone tag characters themselves.
<h3><a name="Names"></a>4.3 Names for the Tag Characters</h3>
The names for the ASCII clone tag characters should be exactly the ISO 10646 
names for 7-bit ASCII, prefixed with the word &quot;TAG&quot;.
<p>In addition, there is one tag identification character and a CANCEL TAG 
character. The use and syntax of these characters is described in detail below.
<p>The entire encoding for the proposed Plane 14 tag characters and names of 
those characters can be derived from the following list. (The encoded values 
here and throughout this technical report are listed in UCS-4 form, which is 
easiest to interpret. It is assumed that most Unicode applications will, 
however, be making use either of UTF-16 or UTF-8 encoding forms for actual 
implementation.)
<pre>U-000E0000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;reserved&gt;
U-000E0001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LANGUAGE TAG
U-000E0002&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;reserved&gt;
...
U-000E001F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;reserved&gt;
U-000E0020&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TAG SPACE
U-000E0021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TAG EXCLAMATION MARK
...
U-000E0041&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TAG LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
...
U-000E007A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TAG LATIN SMALL LETTER Z
...
U-000E007E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TAG TILDE
U-000E007F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CANCEL TAG</pre>
<h3><a name="Range Checking"></a>4.4 Range Checking for Tag Characters</h3>
The range checks required for code testing for tag characters would be as 
follows. The same range check is expressed here in C for each of the three 
significant encoding forms for 10646.
<p>Range check expressed in UCS-4:
<blockquote>
  if ( ( *s &gt;= 0xE0000 ) || ( *s &lt;= 0xE007F ) )
</blockquote>
Range check expressed in UTF-16 (Unicode):
<blockquote>
  if ( ( *s == 0xDB40 ) &amp;&amp; ( *(s+1) &gt;= 0xDC00 ) &amp;&amp; ( *(s+1) 
  &lt;= 0xDC7F ) )
</blockquote>
Expressed in UTF-8:
<blockquote>
  if ( ( *s == 0xF3 ) &amp;&amp; ( *(s+1) == 0xA0 ) &amp;&amp; ( *(s+2) &amp; 
  0xFE == 0x80 ) )
</blockquote>
Because of the choice of the range for the tag characters, it would also be 
possible to express the range check for UCS-4 or UTF-16 in terms of bitmask 
operations, as well.
<h3><a name="Syntax"></a>4.5 Syntax for Embedding Tags</h3>
The use of the Plane 14 tag characters is very simple. In order to embed any 
ASCII-derived tag in Unicode plain text, the tag is simply spelled out with the 
tag characters instead, prefixed with the relevant tag identification character. 
The resultant string is embedded directly in the text.
<p>The tag identification character is used as a mechanism for identifying tags 
of different types. This enables multiple types of tags to coexist amicably 
embedded in plain text and solves the problem of delimitation if a tag is 
concatenated directly onto another tag. Although only one type of tag is 
currently specified, namely the language tag, the encoding of other tag 
identification characters in the future would allow for distinct tag types to be 
used.
<p>No termination character is required for a tag. A tag terminates either when 
the first non Plane 14 Tag Character (i.e. any other normal Unicode value) is 
encountered, or when the next tag identification character is encountered.
<p>All tag arguments must be encoded only with the tag characters U-000E0020 .. 
U-000E007E. No other characters are valid for expressing the tag argument.
<p>A detailed BNF syntax for tags is listed below.
<h3><a name="Language Tags"></a>4.6 Language Tags</h3>
Language tags are of general interest and should have a high degree of 
interoperability for protocol usage. To this end, a specific LANGUAGE TAG tag 
identification character is provided. A Plane 14 tag string prefixed by 
U-000E0001 LANGUAGE TAG is specified to constitute a language tag. Furthermore, 
the tag values for the language tag are to be spelled out as specified in RFC 
1766, making use only of registered tag values or of user-defined language tags 
starting with the characters &quot;x-&quot;.
<p>For example, to embed a language tag for Japanese, the Plane 14 characters 
would be used as follows. The Japanese tag from RFC 1766 is &quot;ja&quot; 
(composed of ISO 639 language id) or, alternatively, &quot;ja-JP&quot; (composed 
of ISO 639 language id plus ISO 3166 country id). Since RFC 1766 specifies that 
language tags are not case significant, it is recommended that for language 
tags, the entire tag be lowercased before conversion to Plane 14 tag characters. 
(This would not be required for Unicode conformance, but should be followed as 
general practice by protocols making use of RFC 1766 language tags, to simplify 
and speed up the processing for operations which need to identify or ignore 
language tags embedded in text.) Lowercasing, rather than uppercasing, is 
recommended because it follows the majority practice of expressing language tag 
values in lowercase letters.
<p>Thus the entire language tag (in its longer form) would be converted to Plane 
14 tag characters as follows:
<p>U-000E0001 U-000E006A U-000E0061 U-000E002D U-000E006A U-000E0070
<p>The language tag (in its shorter, &quot;ja&quot; form) could be expressed as 
follows:
<p>U-000E0001 U-000E006A U-000E0061
<p>The value of this string is then expressed in whichever encoding form (UCS-4, 
UTF-16, UTF-8) is required and embedded in text at the relevant point.
<h3><a name="Additional"></a>4.7 Additional Tag Types</h3>
Additional tag identification characters might be defined in the future. An 
example would be a CHARACTER SET SOURCE TAG, or a GENERIC TAG for private 
definition of tags.
<p>In each case, when a specific tag identification character is encoded, a 
corresponding reference standard for the values of the tags associated with the 
identifier should be designated, so that interoperating parties which make use 
of the tags will know how to interpret the values the tags may take.
<h3><a name="Tag Scope"></a>4.8 Tag Scope and Nesting</h3>
The value of an established tag continues from the point the tag is embedded in 
text until either:
<blockquote>
  A. The text itself goes out of scope, as defined by the application. (E.g. for 
  line-oriented protocols, when reaching the end-of-line or end-of-string; for 
  text streams, when reaching the end-of-stream; etc.)
</blockquote>
or
<blockquote>
  B. The tag is explicitly cancelled by the CANCEL TAG character.
</blockquote>
Tags of the same type cannot be nested in any way. The appearance of a new 
embedded language tag, for example, after text which was already language 
tagged, simply changes the tagged value for subsequent text to that specified in 
the new tag.
<p>Tags of different type can have interdigitating scope, but not hierarchical 
scope. In effect, tags of different type completely ignore each other, so that 
the use of language tags can be completely asynchronous with the use of 
character set source tags (or any other tag type) in the same text in the 
future.
<h3><a name="Cancelling"></a>4.9 Cancelling Tag Values</h3>
U-000E007F CANCEL TAG is provided to allow the specific cancelling of a tag 
value. The use of CANCEL TAG has the following syntax. To cancel a tag value of 
a particular type, prefix the CANCEL TAG character with the tag identification 
character of the appropriate type. For example, the complete string to cancel a 
language tag is:
<p>U-000E0001 U-000E007F
<p>The value of the relevant tag type returns to the default state for that tag 
type, namely: no tag value specified, the same as untagged text.
<p>The use of CANCEL TAG without a prefixed tag identification character cancels 
<i>any</i> Plane 14 tag values which may be defined. Since only language tags 
are currently provided with an explicit tag identification character, only 
language tags are currently affected.
<p>The main function of CANCEL TAG is to make possible such operations as blind 
concatenation of strings in a tagged context without the propagation of 
inappropriate tag values across the string boundaries. For example, a string 
tagged with a Japanese language tag can have its tag value &quot;sealed 
off&quot; with a terminating CANCEL TAG before another string of unknown 
language value is concatenated to it. This would prevent the string of unknown 
language from being erroneously marked as being Japanese simply because of a 
concatenation to a Japanese string.
<h3><a name="Display Issues"></a>4.10 Display Issues</h3>
All characters in the tag character block are considered to have no visible 
rendering in normal text. A process which interprets tags may choose to modify 
the rendering of text based on the tag values (as for example, changing font to 
preferred style for rendering Chinese versus Japanese). The tag characters 
themselves have no display; they may be considered similar to a U+200B ZERO 
WIDTH SPACE in that regard. The tag characters also do not affect breaking, 
joining, or any other format or layout properties, except insofar as the process 
interpreting the tag chooses to impose such behavior based on the tag value.
<p>For debugging or other operations which must render the tags themselves 
visible, it is advisable that the tag characters be rendered using the 
corresponding ASCII character glyphs (perhaps modified systematically to 
differentiate them from normal ASCII characters). But, as noted below, the tag 
character values are chosen so that even without display support, the tag 
characters will be interpretable in most debuggers.
<h3><a name="Unicode Conformance Issues"></a>4.11 Unicode Conformance Issues</h3>
The basic rules for Unicode conformance for the tag characters are exactly the 
same as for any other Unicode characters. A conformant process is not required 
to interpret the tag characters. If it does interpret them, it should interpret 
them according to the standard, i.e. as spelled-out tags. If it does not 
interpret tag characters, it should leave their values undisturbed and do 
whatever it does with any other uninterpreted characters.
<p>So for a non-TagAware Unicode application, any language tag characters (or 
any other kind of tag expressed with Plane 14 tag characters) encountered would 
be handled exactly as for uninterpreted Tibetan from the BMP, uninterpreted 
Linear B from Plane 1, or uninterpreted Egyptian hieroglyphics from private use 
space in Plane 15.
<p>A TagAware but TagPhobic Unicode application can recognize the tag character 
range in Plane 14 and choose to deliberately strip them out completely to 
produce plain text with no tags.
<p>The presence of a correctly formed tag cannot be taken as an absolute 
guarantee that the data so tagged is actually correctly tagged. For example, 
nothing prevents an application from erroneously labelling French data as 
Spanish, or from labelling JIS-derived data as Japanese, even if it contains 
Greek or Cyrillic characters.
<h3><a name="Note"></a>4.12 Note on Encoding Language Tags</h3>
The fact that this technical report for encoding tag characters in Unicode 
includes a mechanism for specifying language tag values does not mean that 
Unicode is departing from one of its basic encoding principles:
<blockquote>
  Unicode encodes scripts, not languages.
</blockquote>
This is still true of the Unicode encoding (and ISO/IEC 10646), even in the 
presence of a mechanism for specifying language tags in plain text.
<p>Language tagging in no way impacts current encoded characters or the encoding 
of future scripts.
<p>It is fully anticipated that implementations of Unicode which already make 
use of out-of-band mechanisms for language tagging or &quot;heavy-weight&quot; 
in-band mechanisms such as HTML will continue to do exactly what they are doing 
and will ignore Plane 14 tag characters completely.
<p>There is nothing obligatory about the use of Plane 14 tags, whether for 
language tags or any other kind of tags. This technical report for Plane 14 tags 
is, instead, aimed at removing a significant barrier to the universal adoption 
of Unicode in such arenas as Internet protocol development.
<h3><a name="Tag Syntax"></a>4.13 Tag Syntax Description</h3>
An extended BNF (Backus-Naur Form) description of the tags specified in this 
technical report is found below. Note the following BNF extensions used in this 
formalism:
<p>1. Semantic constraints are specified by rules in the form of an assertion 
specified between double braces; the variable $$ denotes the string consisting 
of all terminal symbols matched by the this non-terminal.
<blockquote>
  Example: {{ Assert ( $$[0] == '?' ); }}
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Meaning: The first character of the string matched by this non-terminal must 
  be '?'
</blockquote>
2. A number of predicate functions are employed in semantic constraint rules 
which are not otherwise defined; their name is sufficient for determining their 
predication.
<blockquote>
  Example: IsRFC1766LanguageIdentifier ( tag-argument )
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Meaning: tag-argument is a valid RFC1766 language identifier
</blockquote>
3. A lexical expander function, TAG, is employed to denote the tag form of an 
ASCII character; the argument to this function is either a character or a 
character set specified by a range or enumeration expression.
<blockquote>
  Example: TAG('-')
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Meaning: TAG HYPHEN-MINUS
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Example: TAG([A-Z])
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Meaning: TAG LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A ... TAG LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z
</blockquote>
4. A macro is employed to denote terminal symbols that are character literals 
which can't be directly represented in ASCII. The argument to the macro is the 
UNICODE (ISO/IEC 10646) character name.
<blockquote>
  Example: '${TAG CANCEL}'
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Meaning: character literal whose code value is U-000E007F
</blockquote>
5. Occurrence indicators used are '+' (one or more) and '*' (zero or more);
