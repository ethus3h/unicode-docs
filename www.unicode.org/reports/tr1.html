<h1>Document</h1>

<p>This Technical Report is comprised of three concrete proposals to which the Unicode
Technical Committee is strongly committed in their current form. These are: Ethiopian,
Burmese, and Khmer. These proposals have been reviewed internally and have been relatively
stable over a period of time. The committee believes they represent good technical
solutions for the proposed scripts, and therefore also recommends that specific codepoints
within the body of Unicode be allocated for them, as follows: </p>

<p>Burmese U+0F00 U+0F7F<br>
Khmer U+0F80 U+0FFF<br>
Ethiopian U+1200 U+125F </p>

<p>Specific open issues for each of these are addressed in the respective draft block
introductions. These open issues do not detract substantially from the solidity of the
proposals. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Burmese Proposal Description</h2>

<p>Burmese U+0F00 -&gt; 0F7F </p>

<p>The Burmese script is used to write Burmese, the majority language of Myanmar (formerly
Burma) and Pali. Variations and extentions of the script are used to write other languages
of the region, such as Shan and Mon, and also to write Sanskrit. </p>

<p>The Burmese script derives from 11th century Mon. The Mon script itself is probably
borrowed directly from South India. The earliest Mon inscription, found at Lopburi in
Thailand, dates from the eight century and is written in the Pallava script used at the
Hinayana Buddhist center of Conjeeveram in the area of Madras on the east coast of India.
In A.D. 1057 one of the first Burmese kings, Aniruddha, conquered Thaton, a major Mon
center, and brought back with him to Pagan the most learned monks, artists and artisans of
the Mon. The first inscription in Burmese dates from the following year and is written in
an alphabet almost identical with that of the Mon inscriptions. Aside from rounding of the
originally square characters, this script has remained largely unchanged to the present. </p>

<p>The Burmese script therfore ultimately derives from Brahmi, and so shares the
structural features of its relatives: Consonant symbols include an inherent vowel; various
signs are placed before, above, below and after a consonant to indicate a vowel other than
the inherent one; ligatures and conjuncts are used to indicate consonant clusters. </p>

<p>In the course of its adaptation to non-Indo-Aryan languages, the<br>
Burmese script has acquired some features that distinguish it from<br>
other Indic scripts. The killer, or virama, participates in some<br>
common constructions that would be clumsy to handle the way they<br>
would be in the other Indic scripts, so the control function of<br>
the virama is separated from the diacritic function of the killer.<br>
The virama, 0F4D is used to form conjunct consonants, while the<br>
killer, 0F52, is a simple diacritic and has no effect on character<br>
shaping. The killer is also combined with the VOWEL SIGN O (0F4B)<br>
to form the low level tone vowel &quot;o.&quot; When used this way, this<br>
symbol is known as hyei hto, or &quot;thrust forward.&quot; </p>

<p>Burmese distinguishes as set of &quot;medial&quot; consonants. Originally<br>
conjunct forms of YA PALE, YA GAU, WA and HA, they are used in<br>
modern Burmese to form new letters and to spell certain vowel and<br>
consonant combinations. They are treated here as no different from<br>
any other conjunct and should be coded using the virama. </p>

<p>ISSUE: There's no reason from the point of view of the rendering<br>
engine to have separate codes for the medials. Some implementors<br>
feel that the medials should nevertheless have separate codes.<br>
Including them introduces alternate spellings for the same syllables,<br>
something that should be avoided. If there are compelling reasons<br>
for including the medials, there is certainly room to add them. </p>

<p>When a syllable has more than one medial, it is recommended that<br>
they appear in the order that such syllables are traditionally<br>
spelled. That is, HA HTOU, before YA PIN or YA YI, before WA HSWE.<br>
Note that YA PIN and YA YI cannot appear in the same syllable in<br>
Burmese. For example, &quot;cwei&quot; (&quot;to drop off&quot;) is coded as<br>
0F15+0F5C+0F5E+0F47. &quot;Hmyu&quot; (&quot;to delight, allure&quot;) is coded as<br>
0F2E+0F5F+0F5D+0F42. This differs from the order in which medials<br>
are normally written. </p>

<p>ISSUE: This rule is not strictly necessary, but regularizes the<br>
spelling and simplifies rendering, string comparison and other<br>
functions. </p>

<p>Burmese has several glyphs that are used with varying semantics<br>
which are here given separate code points for each different usage.<br>
The following pairs of letters look the same, but must be distinguished<br>
in the text stream: </p>

<p>EHKAYA U (0F09) and NYA GALEI (0F5B)<br>
GA NGE (0F17) and DIGIT HYI (0F6E)<br>
WA (0F35) and DIGIT THOUN NYA (0F66)<br>
YA GAU (0F30) and DIGIT HKUN NI (0F6D)<br>
DIGIT LEI (0F6A) and SYMBOL LAGAUN (0F73) </p>

<p>The last two pairs are distinguished in some fonts but not in<br>
others. </p>

<p>Also, the LETTER 0 (0F13) is distinguished from the sequence<br>
0F48+0F5D, and the ZA MYINZWE is distinguished from 0F1A+0F5C. </p>

<p>Symbols not found as single characters are formed from sequences<br>
of the basic characters given here. For example,tha ji (&quot;great<br>
tha&quot;) is coded by the sequence 0F38+0F4D+0F38, i.e., it is a conjunct<br>
formed from two THAs. Kinzi is a conjunct formed from LETTER NGA<br>
followed by some other consonant, that is, the sequence<br>
0F19+0F4D+Consonant. Low level tone &quot;o&quot; has already been noted.<br>
Level tone &quot;ou&quot; is to be coded as 0F41+0F3F. Other combinations<br>
follow similarly. </p>

<p>The LETTER A, though classified here are a vowel, is actually a<br>
consonant. Thus it can combine with any of the vowel symbols. </p>

<p>The tone mark AUKA MYI is often written to the left of a subscript<br>
vowel sign or medial consonant. It should, nevertheless come after<br>
the vowel or medial in the text stream. It is also used with killed<br>
consonants in writing closed syllables. In this case, too, the AUKA<br>
MYI should come after the ATHA in the text stream. For example,<br>
the word /hyun./ (short, high falling tone) should be represented<br>
as 0F30+0F5F+0F5E+0F02+0F51. </p>

<p>The SYMBOL HNAI is only used in the literary combination<br>
0F73+0F19+0F52+0F03, meaning &quot;the aforementioned.&quot; </p>

<p>Burmese does not use any whitespace between words. If word boundary<br>
indications are desired, for example for the use of automatic line<br>
layout algorithms, U+200B, ZERO WIDTH SPACE, is to be used. </p>

<p>Block Structure: Burmese characters are mapped to their corresponding<br>
ISCII slots whenever possible. Gaps in the block result mainly from<br>
this mapping. Several ranges of code points are reserved for future<br>
expansion. A notable exception is the pair NYA GALEI and NYA JI.<br>
Historically, NYA GALEI is a simple palatal nasal, while NYA JI is<br>
a ligature representing a double NYA GALEI. NYA JI, however, has<br>
come to be regarded as the primary form of the letter in Burmese,<br>
so it is assigned to the &quot;preferred&quot; ISCII slot for the palatal<br>
nasal (U+0F1E), and NYA GALEI is placed at U+0F5F. </p>

<p>Note: The transliteration used here follows D. Haigh Roop, An Introduction to the
Burmese Writing System (1972). Tone indications are left out of the character names. </p>

<p>ISSUE: As with Khmer, if there is a more standard transliteration,<br>
it should be used. </p>

<p>ISSUE: Old Burmese has a small subscript LETTER A, which is the<br>
precursor of the tone mark AUKA MYA and appears exactly where modern<br>
Burmese would use the latter. This can probably be treated as a<br>
font difference. There is also a superscript form of YA GAU, similar<br>
in use to the Indic repha. This can probably be accommodated in<br>
the shaping rules. This is not a major issue as there is plenty of<br>
room to add these characters. Further investigation is required. </p>

<p><font size="3">Khmer U+0F80 -&gt; 0FDF</font><br>
<br>
Cambodian, also known as Khmer, is the official language of Cambodia.<br>
Mutually intelligible dialects are also spoken in northeastern<br>
Thailand and the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam. While not itself<br>
an Indo-European language, much of the administrative, military<br>
and literary vocabulary of Khmer is borrowed from Sanskrit. With<br>
the advent of Theravada Buddhism at the beginning of the fifteenth<br>
century, Khmer began to borrow Pali words, and continues to use<br>
Pali as a major source of neologisms today. There is also much<br>
cross-borrowing between Thai and Khmer, as well as a relatively<br>
recent infusion of French words and a smattering of Chinese and<br>
Vietnamese loanwords in colloquial speech.<br>
<br>
The Khmer script, called a'saa kmae (&quot;Khmer letters&quot;), as well as<br>
Thai, Lao, Burmese, Old Mon and others, are all descended from the<br>
Brahmi script of South India. The exact geographical source, or<br>
possibly sources, has not been determined, but there is a great<br>
similarity between the earliest inscriptions in the region and the<br>
Pallawa script of the Coromandel coast of India.<br>
<br>
Structurally, the Khmer script stays very close to its southern<br>
Brahmi origins. There is a set of 35 consonants, each with an<br>
inherent vowel sound. Additional signs are placed before, above,<br>
below and after the consonants to indicate vowels other than the<br>
inherent one. Consonant clusters are represented by conjunct<br>
consonants, where the first consonant of the cluster maintains its<br>
full form and succeeding consonants are written as subscripts.<br>
<br>
The Khmer language has a much richer set of vowels than the Indo-Aryan<br>
languages for which the ancestral script was used. By the same<br>
token, there is a much smaller set of consonant sounds. The Khmer<br>
script is adapted to the language by adding extra vowel signs and<br>
various diacritic marks, and by using the choice of consonant as<br>
well as of vowel signs to determine the particular vowel sound<br>
represented. Thus most vowel signs do not have a single value but<br>
must be interpreted in the context of the associated consonant.<br>
This is very similar to the situation in Thai and Lao, where<br>
different consonant symbols have the same sound but encode different<br>
tones.<br>
<br>
There are two basic styles of script in modern Khmer, each with<br>
two major variations. They are the a'saa criang (&quot;slanted script&quot;)<br>
and the a'saa muul (&quot;round script&quot;). There is no fundamental<br>
structural difference between them, however, so the &quot;standing&quot;<br>
variant of the slanted script is chosen here as representative.<br>
<br>
Representation:<br>
<br>
The Khmer script follows the model of Devanagari and other Indic<br>
scripts. The basic unit is the syllabic cluster consisting of a<br>
series of consonants separated by WIRIAM (0FC5), followed by one<br>
or both of the pronounciation shifters MUSEKATOAN (0FCA) and TRUYSAP<br>
(0FCB), followed by an optional vowel, followed by diacritics and<br>
quality marks. For example, the word /knyom/, &quot;I,&quot; is coded as the<br>
string 0F81+0FC5+0F89+0FB5+0FC2.<br>
<br>
In cases where there is already some other superscript in the<br>
cluster, the two pronounciation shifters are written as the subscript<br>
symbol kbiah kraom, which looks much like VOWEL SIGN O. This vowel<br>
sign is not to be used for this purpose. It is the responsibility<br>
of the presentation software to select the correct appearance of<br>
the shifter. For example, /sii/, &quot;to eat,&quot; should be coded as<br>
0F9F+0FCB+0FB4, not as 0F9F+0FB7+0FB4.<br>
<br>
RAWBAT (0FCC) historically corresponds to the Devanagari repha,<br>
that is, to an initial /r/. It has lost this function in Khmer and<br>
instead is considered a simple diacritic similar to TOANDAKHIAT in<br>
both reading and sorting. There are also many cases of consonant<br>
clusters with initial /r/ that should be written with a full RAW<br>
and not a RAWBAT, so a separate character is provided for it.<br>
<br>
Khmer writing does not normally separate words with white space as<br>
European languages do. If it is desirable to represent word boundaries<br>
in the text stream, for example, for use by automatic line layout<br>
algorithms, U+200B, ZERO WIDTH SPACE, should be used.<br>
<br>
Two relatively rare symbols in modern usage are not included here.<br>
They are pnek moan, the &quot;cock's eye,&quot; and &quot;komout.&quot; They are<br>
identical in form and function to the Thai characters FONGMAN and<br>
KHOMUT, respectively, so the latter two should be used when these<br>
symbols are needed.<br>

ISSUES: The independent vowels LETTER AO TYPE 2 and LETTER AW TYPE<br>
2 are variant forms of LETTER AO TYPE 1 and LETTER AW TYPE 1,<br>
respectively. It is not believed that they are in free variation:<br>
LETTER AO TYPE 2 occurs only in the combination &quot;aoy,&quot; while LETTER<br>
AW TYPE 2 is only cited in a few references, but not used. There<br>
is an opportunity to unify these pairs. Note that LETTER UW and<br>
LETTER OU are also listed as variants, but they are actually not<br>
in free variation, so both must be provided.<br>
<br>
It may be desirable to add the vowel sign AM instead of using the<br>
combination AA+NIKAHAT. This would simplify a common special case<br>
in sorting.<br>
<br>
The punctuation marks KHAN and BARIYAOSAN may be unified with some<br>
other characters, just as Indic dandas have been. A likely candidate<br>
for the former is Thai PAI YAN NOI. Such a unification, as well as<br>
that of the &quot;cock's eye&quot; and &quot;cow piss&quot; characters presents an<br>
interesting challenge to the font mechanism of a Unicode rendering<br>
engine: Different glyphs may be required for the same character<br>
when used in conjunction with different scripts. This seems like<br>
a needless complication for what are otherwise simple, non-combining<br>
characters.<br>
<br>
It may be more desirable from a political standpoint to follow<br>
either the Thai or the ISCII coding schemes. Sample charts have<br>
been produced showing how this may be done. If this is indeed the<br>
path taken, those charts should be expanded to include all characters<br>
in this proposal.<br>
<br>
The vowel encoding takes an ISCII-like approach, coding as single<br>
characters vowels that consist of two or more disjoint glyphs. If<br>
vowel symbols are instead decomposed into their constituent glyphs<br>
and those coded separately, there is then no advantage to the code<br>
point assignments made here. In such a case, the assignments should<br>
be made according to the Thai pattern.<br>
<br>
The romanization scheme here is rather ad-hoc. If a more commonly<br>
accepted one exists, the character names should be changed accordingly.<br>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Proposal for Ethiopian Encoding</strong></font><br>
<br>
The Ethiopian proposal consists of a list of questions/issues, a<br>
chart, a character names list, and a block introduction. The<br>
content is based on UTC/1991-026 On the Extended Ethiopic Alphabet<br>
of February 26, 1991 and its later adjustments by Lloyd Anderson,<br>
unioned with features of the Xerox Amharic implementation by Joe<br>
Becker. The character names are based on those in DP 10646, which<br>
came from WG2/N459 &quot;Ethiopian character sets&quot; by Michael Mann.<br>
<br>
QUESTIONS FOR REVIEWERS:<br>
<br>
1. Is this collection missing any important, well-established<br>
&quot;extension&quot; letters for writing less-common languages?<br>
<br>
2. Are the glyphs in the charts appropriate?<br>
<br>
3. Can you supply documentation to support the specification of<br>
the following two characters?<br>
121D ETHIOPIAN CONSONANT GG 1237<br>
ETHIOPIAN VOWEL PHONETIC AE In particular, does U+1237<br>
occur (as a vowel, not as a mark of &quot;w&quot; rounding) on any consonant<br>
other than U+1211? Should the combination of U+1237 with U+1211<br>
simply be encoded as a distinct consonant (to be added between<br>
current U+1211 and U+1212)?<br>
<br>
4. Are the following characters specified correctly?<br>
1256 ETHIOPIAN COMMA<br>
modern usage like colon<br>
1257 ETHIOPIAN COLON<br>
modern usage like semicolon<br>
1259 ETHIOPIAN NEW COMMA<br>
modern usage<br>
<br>
5. Do syllable glyph variants ever occur distinctively within the<br>
same text, or are they merely font design choices like the glyph<br>
variants of Latin &quot;a&quot; or &quot;g&quot;?<br>
<br>
ISSUES:<br>
<br>
* In this design, no provision is made for coding the syllable<br>
glyphs; it is intended that they be excluded from Unicode/10646<br>
BMP. If we learn that glyph variants may occur distinctively, then<br>
we may need to define some additional means for specifying glyph<br>
variants within plain text.<br>
<br>
* Should we define an Ethiopian White Space character which can be<br>
easily guaranteed to have the same (minimum) width as U+1255<br>
ETHIOPIAN WORDSPACE? Currently opinion is that this is unnecessary.<br>
<br>
Ethiopian (U+1200 -&gt; U+125F)<br>
<br>
The Ethiopian script, which originally evolved for the archaic<br>
language Ge'ez, is currently used to write several languages of<br>
Eastern Africa, including Amharic, Tigre, and Oromo. The script<br>
continues to be extended for writing languages that have little<br>
tradition of printed typography; new characters to cover such<br>
extensions may added to the standard later as definitive information<br>
about them becomes available.<br>
<br>
Encoding Principles. The visible glyphs of the Ethiopian script<br>
are not the objects shown in the encoding chart. The elements of<br>
the encoding are the alphabet underlying the script, thus the<br>
encoding is (roughly) phonetic rather than glyphic. These alphabetic<br>
letters are expected to be the units of keyboard input and all text<br>
representation short of rendering.<br>
<br>
Rendering. Each visible glyph of the Ethiopian script represents<br>
a syllable rather than a single letter. The syllables can all be<br>
treated as simple (consonant + vowel) pairs, so that each glyph<br>
can be thought of as a ligature of two underlying letters. Thus<br>
the syllable &quot;MA&quot; would be represented in the encoding as U+1203<br>
ETHIOPIAN CONSONANT M plus U+1233 ETHIOPIAN VOWEL A. The syllable<br>
glyphs themselves are not intended to be incorporated in this<br>
encoding. The individual consonant or vowel codes should not be<br>
isolated (i.e. unpaired) in normal final text, and their rendering<br>
in such circumstances is an option of the implementation. One<br>
possibility is to use special symbols for the individual letters,<br>
as is done in the code charts here.<br>
<br>
Chart Symbols Representing Individual Letters. Since the Ethiopian<br>
glyphs are normally syllabic, the script provides no unambiguous<br>
way of representing the underlying individual letters. Therefore<br>
in the code charts and names list, a convention has been adopted<br>
in which consonant letters are represented by their &quot;first&quot; form<br>
surrounded by a dotted circle, and vowel letters are represented<br>
by a typical glyph fragment attached to a dotted circle. This is<br>
not intended to imply direct glyphic composition of those forms,<br>
but merely to signify the underlying letters.<br>
<br>
Encoding/Rendering of &quot;First Form&quot; Syllables. The circled consonants<br>
in the charts U+1200 -&gt; U+1224 are underlying letters, they should<br>
not be confused with rendered full first form syllable glyphs. As<br>
with all glyphs in the script, the first form syllables are encoded<br>
as simple (consonant + vowel) pairs. Thus the glyph &quot;MAE&quot; would<br>
be represented in the encoding as U+1203 ETHIOPIAN CONSONANT M plus<br>
U+1230 ETHIOPIAN VOWEL AE. This pair would then be rendered via<br>
a &quot;ligature&quot; MAE whose appearance would resemble the chart symbol<br>
for U+1203 ETHIOPIAN CONSONANT M without the circle.<br>
<br>
Encoding/Rendering of Lone Consonants (&quot;Sixth Form&quot; Syllables).<br>
The sixth form syllable glyphs are sometimes pronounced as though<br>
they were lone consonants (i.e. the vowel is dropped in speech),<br>
but this does not change their encoding. As with all glyphs in the<br>
script, the sixth form syllables are encoded as simple (consonant<br>
+ vowel) pairs. Thus the spoken lone consonant &quot;M&quot; would be<br>
represented in the encoding as U+1203 ETHIOPIAN CONSONANT M plus<br>
U+1235 ETHIOPIAN VOWEL SCHWA.<br>
<br>
Variant Glyph Forms. The script sometimes provides different glyph<br>
forms to represent the same syllables. It is assumed that these<br>
alternatives do not vary freely, in other words that is appropriate<br>
for a given font to contain only one selected glyph form for each<br>
syllable. Therefore no mechanism is provided for specifying glyph<br>
variants within a plain text stream of characters. The situation<br>
is analogous to that of the glyph variants of Latin &quot;a&quot; or &quot;g&quot;.<br>
<br>
Letter Names. The Ethiopian script often has multiple letters<br>
corresponding to the same Latin letter, making it difficult to<br>
assign unique Latin names. Therefore the names list makes use of<br>
certain devices (such as doubling a Latin letter in the name) merely<br>
to create uniqueness; this has no relation to the phonetics of the<br>
Ethiopian letters.<br>
<br>
Encoding Order and Sorting. The order of the letters in the encoding<br>
is based on the traditional alphabetical order. This order differs<br>
from the sort order used for one or another language, if only<br>
because in many languages various pairs or triplets of letters are<br>
treated as equivalent in the first sorting pass. For example, an<br>
Amharic dictionary is likely to start out with a section headed by<br>
three letters:<br>
<br>
U+1200 ETHIOPIAN CONSONANT H<br>
U+1202 ETHIOPIAN CONSONANT HH<br>
U+120E ETHIOPIAN CONSONANT X<br>
<br>
Thus the encoding order cannot and does not implement a collation<br>
procedure for any particular language using this script.<br>
<br>
Space Characters. The traditional word separator is U+1255 ETHIOPIAN<br>
WORDSPACE ( : ), but in modern usage a plain white wordspace is<br>
becoming common. The ASCII character U+0020 SPACE is suitable for<br>
the latter usage, although its (minimum) width is not guaranteed<br>
to be the same as that of the traditional wordspace.<br>
<br>
Diacritical Marks. The mark U+030E NON-SPACING DOUBLE VERTICAL<br>
LINE ABOVE may occasionally be used to indicate emphasis or<br>
gemination. If this or other diacritical marks are used, they<br>
follow the vowel letter of the syllable to which they apply.<br>
<br>
Encoding Structure. The Unicode block for the Ethiopian script is<br>
divided into the following ranges:<br>
<br>
U+1200 to U+1224 Consonant phonetic letters<br>
U+1225 to U+122F Currently unassigned<br>
U+1230 to U+123D Vowel phonetic letters (U+1239 is an intentional gap)<br>
U+123E to U+123F Currently unassigned<br>
U+1240 to U+1254 Numbers (U+1240 is an intentional gap)<br>
U+1255 to U+125B Punctuation<br>
U+125C to U+125F Currently unassigned<br>
