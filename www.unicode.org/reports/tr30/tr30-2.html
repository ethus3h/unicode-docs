  <h2><a name="_Toc1"></a>1 Scope</h2>              
  <p>This report identifies a set of character foldings, in other words,         
  operations that map similar characters to a common target. Such operations are         
  used to ignore certain distinctions between similar characters and are useful         
  for &quot;fuzzy&quot; or &quot;loose&quot; searches, among other things. Each         
  of the folding operations specified in this report has well-understood         
  properties, and is appropriate in specific contexts. For example some         
  identifiers need case folding, some do not. Some text searches need to         
  preserve superscript form such as the <i>trademark symbol </i>™, while         
  others do not. Not all of these folding operations may be appropriate in a         
  give context. See <a href="tr30-2.html#_Toc52">Section 5.2</a> for some of the more         
  problematic folding or expansion operations.</p>         
  <p>The report also a provides an algorithm for combining these operations for
  the purpose of searching or programmatic identifier matching. They combine
  canonical normalization with optional folding operations. This allows
  implementers to decide which folding option is useful for a particular
  purpose.</p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc2">2 </a>Introduction</h2> 
  A folding function a folding operation removes a distinction              
  between related characters by mapping them to the same target.&nbsp; For example,          
  a case folding may removes the case distinction, by replacing              
    upper and title case variants of a character with the lower case. In other          
  words, foldings define equivalence classes, and chose a representative or          
  target member for each equivalence class.<p>Foldings can be transient, for         
  example the same folding can be applied to two strings before comparison, or  
  they can be a permanent transformation of the text, for example when applying 
  the Positional Forms Folding to converting legacy data that uses explicit 
  Arabic positional shapes to the generic Arabic characters with implicit 
  directionality.</p>
  <h3><a name="2.1 Search term folding">2.1 Search term folding</a></h3> 
  <p>For the purpose of fuzzy text matching, including both programmatic
  identifier matching and general text searching, it is often necessary to
  selectively ignore otherwise meaningful distinctions between related
  characters, for example upper and lower case, removal of accent marks, etc.
  This process can be called <i>search term folding</i>. Depending on the
  operation, different foldings need to be applied, and possible interactions
  must be carefully managed. False positive matches may be acceptable more often
  than false negative matches.</p>
  <p>A significant aspect of string foldings for programmatic identifier matching 
  is that the set of allowable 
  characters is restricted. Issues that relate to identifier matching in 
  particular are addressed 
  specifically below.</p> 
  <h3><a name="_Toc22">2.2 Relation to Normalization</a></h3> 
  <p>Normalization [<a href="tr30-2.html#Normalization">Normalization</a>] is part of any    
  robust search term folding algorithm (see section <a href="tr30-2.html#_Toc411">Section 4.1.1    
  <i>Basic Folding Algorithm</i></a>).&nbsp;    
  However, there are some important differences between normalization and the    
  foldings that make up search term folding. Normalization, particular the    
  canonical forms (NFC or NFD) are often        
  intended for permanent transformation of data,&nbsp; while search term folding        
  is by nature transient. Further, unlike the other foldings considered here,    
  normalization it is not context-independent, since the equivalences are not    
  between characters, but character sequences.</p>   
  <p> As defined, the normalization forms offer only two broad        
  levels of distinctions (they either preserve or do not preserve compatibility        
  distinctions).&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice of which distinctions may be ignored for search term folding       
  needs to be more specific; it depends on the nature of the operation. One size       
  does not fit all.</p>    
  <p>For example, two of the normalization forms depend on compatibility
  mappings which replace character by their compatibility decompositions.
  Applying certain of these compatibility mappings may lead to unintended false
  positive matches, preventing their use in general text searches. In
  combination with whole word search it could even lead to unintended false
  negatives. (See <a href="tr30-2.html#_Toc52">Section 5.2 <i>Problematical foldings</i></a>).</p>
  <p>Furthermore, normalization and case folding are defined as separate and       
  independent operations, but&nbsp; case folding often occurs together with       
  other foldings in search term folding. In order to avoid inconsistencies,       
  search term folding needs to address the interaction of case folding with the       
  other steps in the algorithm.</p>       
  <p>Search term folding includes canonical normalization; however, whether the       
  normalized text is in the composed (NFC) or decomposed form (NFD) is of       
  secondary importance in terms of defining the foldings. Due to the transient       
  nature of search term folding, the distinction between NFC and NFD is       
  immaterial, as long as the two forms are not mixed.&nbsp;</p>       
  <h3><a name="_Toc23">2.3 Relation to Collation</a></h3>       
  <p>Like foldings, the comparisons at  
  the heart of the <a href="../tr10/index.html">Unicode  
  Collation Algorithm</a> [UCA] also define equivalences. One can derive a  
  specific folding by applying the collation algorithm with a particular  
  strength and specific tailorings. Foldings derived in this manner can be useful in  
  searches that ignore similar distinctions to those ignored in collation. Such  
  foldings are not subject of this report.</p>  
  <h2><a name="_Toc3">3 Definitions</a></h2> 
  <p><i>All terms not defined here are used as defined in the Unicode Standard 
  or in the online [<a href="tr30-2.html#Glossary">Glossary</a>].</i></p> 
  <p><b>Folding operation</b> — an idempotent context-independent string function.&nbsp;</p>      
  <blockquote>
  <p>
      Idempotent means that the output of the function is a string, and repeated      
      applications of the same function produce the same output: F(F(S)) = F(S)      
      for all S.     
      Every folding establishes a set of equivalence classes that partitions all      
      strings, where X = Y if and only if F(X) = F(Y)..&nbsp;</p>     
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Codepoint count-preserving folding</b> — a folding that folds any      
  string&nbsp; to a string of equal number of code points.</p>      
  <blockquote>
    <p>Other foldings may replace individual characters by a character sequence.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Multigraph expansion</b> — a multigraph expansion replaces a 
  digraph or higher multigraph, such as <i>double prime</i> or <i>triple prime</i>, 
  by its expansion into an equivalent sequence of base characters, in this case, 
  two or three single <i>prime </i>characters.</p> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The distinction from other expansions is that the character sequence is
    not a combining character sequence.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Provisional folding</b> — a folding operation for which only a 
  provisional definition exists.</p>

  <p><h2>4<a name="_Toc4"> Specifications</a></h2>   
  <p>All specifications of algorithms are in terms of results—all      
  implementations that achieve the same result are fully equivalent. In      
  particular, implementations commonly use optimization techniques, such as      
  normalizing and folding 'on demand'.&nbsp;</p>    
  <h3><a name="_Toc41">4.1 Folding algorithm</a></h3>    
  <h4><a name="_Toc411">4.1.1 Basic Folding Algorithm</a></h4> 
  <p>The basic algorithm for search term folding can be stated as</p>
  <p>a. Apply optional&nbsp; folding operations<br>     
  b. Apply canonical decomposition<br>     
  c. Repeat (<b>a)</b> and (<b>b)</b> until stable<br>     
  d. Apply composition if necessary</p>     
  <p>where each step is applied on the whole string, and applies to the result 
  of the preceding operation. Implementations may be able to avoid step <b> (c)</b> by 
  applying additional transformations.</p> 
  <h4><a name="_Toc412">4.1.2 Identifier Folding algorithm</a></h4> 
  <p>For identifier folding, it is important to account for prohibited 
  characters. This adds a new step <b>(e)</b>. The modified basic algorithm then 
  becomes:</p>
  <p>a. Apply optional&nbsp; folding operations&nbsp;<br>     
  b. Apply canonical decomposition<br>     
  c. Repeat <b> a</b> and <b>b</b> until stable<br>     
  d. Apply composition if necessary<br>     
  e. Eliminate or flag forbidden characters</p>     
  <p>Foldings in step <b> (a)</b> can be modified to also disallow certain characters by    
  mapping them to forbidden characters, which are then caught in step <b>(e)</b>.    
  Implementations may be able to avoid step <b> (c)</b> by applying additional    
  transformations.</p>
  <h3><a name="_Toc42">4.2 Specification of folding operations</a></h3> 
  <p>The following table summarizes the definition of a number of important and
  well-defined folding operations for which the data are availble in the Unicode
  Character Database[<a href="tr30-2.html#UCD">UCD</a>].
  Foldings that are <i>multigraph expansions</i> have been collected at the end
  of the table.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <i>description</i> column identifies the folding.</li>
    <li>The <i>source</i> column identifies the set of characters subject to the      
      folding operation by referencing a set of code points, a set of general      
      categories, or a compatibility mapping tag. All characters matching the      
      source condition are subject to the given folding. Note that this column      
      does <i>not</i> indicate the set of characters with which the source      
      characters are equivalenced by the folding.&nbsp;</li>     
    <li>The <i>target</i> column indicates the result of the folding, either by     
      reference to an operation, or, in some cases, by providing the single     
      Unicode character to which a whole set of source characters is folded.</li>     
    <li>The <i>data file</i> column indicates which data file carries the

  <p><b>Notes:&nbsp;</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>some transformations (such as case, or width) in principle would allow a    
      free choice or representative target for each equivalence class (e.g. the    
      upper case or the lower case character for case folding), but the    
      predefined foldings select a preferred default target.</li>   
    <li>some target characters (such as 203E) are also subject to another folding, other  
      than case folding</li> 
  </ul>
  <h2><a name="_Toc5">5 Notes and Guidelines</a></h2>  
  <h3><a name="_Toc51">5.1 General notes</a></h3> 
  <p>The most important guideline is &quot;discriminate&quot;. Understand the 
  effect before applying a folding. Do not apply any of these folding all at 
  once just because it exists, and certainly never all of them at once. The 
  following notes on individual foldings or issues may be of help in following 
  this guideline.</p>
  <h4>5.1.1 Case folding</h4>
  <p>The [<a href="tr30-2.html#CaseFolding">CaseFolding</a>] data file provides case
  folding information. For more information see Section 5.18 <i>Case
  Mappings</i> in [<a href="tr30-2.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
  <h4>5.1.2 Diacritic folding</h4>
  <p>Diacritic folding goes beyond the decomposition and removal of accents,     
  umlauts, cedillas etc. that is provided by the canonical decompositions,     
  but&nbsp; also includes barred, slashed forms etc, as well as hooks,     
  descenders, etc.</p>     
  <h4>5.1.3 Letter forms</h4>
  <p>Greek letter forms should be folded for Greek text. They should <b>not</b>
  be folded for mathematical and scientific usage as doing so would conflate
  very distinct concepts. To give an example of common usage consider physics,
  which distinguishes angle encoded by <i>theta</i> and temperature encoded by <i>theta
  symbol</i>.</p>
  <p><font color="#008080"><i>[Ed. note: In the datafile, letterforms need to have 'final sigma'     
  and 'final, +alternate Hebrew' added to them.&nbsp;]</i></font></p>     
  <h4>5.1.4 Han Character Foldings</h4>
  <h5>Han Radical folding</h5>
  <p>Han Radical folding substitutes a Unified ideograph for a Han radical.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Note that the compatibility decomposition for Han Radicals is inconsistent and should
      not be used for Radical folding.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Simplified / traditional folding</h5>
  <p>Simplified and traditional forms of Han ideographs are separately encoded 
  in Unicode, even where they represent the same meaning. This folding would 
  remove the distinction. In practice, there are additional differences in Han 
  character usage between writers of simplified and traditional Han ideographs, 
  some of which cannot be folded without context and semantic information. A 
  simple 1:1folding is nevertheless useful for many purposes.</p>
  <h5>Turtle folding <font color="#008080"><i>[Ed. note: better name.]</i></font></h5>
  <p>As results of historical development of the Han ideograph there are 
  multiple variations of characters for the same concept, for example there are 
  47 variants for 'turtle'. Such folding would remove such variations. The 
  process of defining such a folding for all such cases will be difficult and 
  lengthy.</p>
  <h5>Source separation foldings</h5>
  <p>The Unicode Standard maintains duplications for certain Han ideographs 
  based on the fact that they were separately encoded <i>within</i> a given 
  source character set. A Han source separation folding would equivalence such 
  separated characters.</p> 
  <h4>5.1.4 Kana Foldings</h4>
  <p>Japanese Katakana and Hiragana are two generally equivalent syllabaries,     
  where each Hiragana syllable has a corresponding Katakana syllable. Foldings   
  in both directions are useful, depending on the situation. However,     
  since Katakana are used to represent the pronunciation of foreign words in     
  Japanese, there are more Katakana than Hiragana characters.&nbsp;</p>    
  <p>There is one important difference in orthography between the syllabaries,     
  affecting the way the long syllables are expressed. Hiragana uses an     
  additional vowel, while Katakana uses a length mark. If this is taken into     
  account, the folding is no longer context free. In fact, these are better seen   
  as examples of algorithmic transliterations, such as the ISCII   
  transliterations between Indic scripts.</p>    
  <h4>5.1.5 Semantically neutral foldings</h4>
  <p>Semantically neutral foldings could be defined as those foldings that     
  simply remove a distinction that is more or less purely an artifact of the     
  encoding itself. Under the right circumstances, these foldings are in     
  principle candidates for permanent data transformation. This is primarily true for the canonical decomposition and composition, but could also     
  apply to text using the Arabic positional forms. If such a text is converted     
  to use non-positional forms, but rendered via a standard Unicode rendering     
  process, the appearance would be the same (except for deliberately odd     
  combinations of positional shapes). In practice it is far more likely that the     
  data containing the positional forms will display poorly on a system that   
  expects characters with implicit positional shaping.&nbsp;</p>  
  <p>The following foldings can be considered semantically neutral</p>     
  <ul>
    <li>Arabic positional forms folding</li>
    <li>Vertical forms folding</li>
    <li>Canonical decomposition and composition, excepting Han compatibility 
      characters.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that Arabic positional folding, especially when intended as a 
  permanent data transformation, may need to introduce ZWJ or ZWNJ characters.</p>
  <h4><i>5.1.6 Foldings based on tailored collation data</i></h4>
  <p>Foldings based on tailored collation data would fold characters that are
  'nearly equivalent' in a particular language. For example, a locale-based
  folding for Swedish could follow common practice in Sweden and match the
  following pairs of character sequences, among others, based on equivalence in
  pronunciation.</p>

    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>In other words, locale-based foldings would be different for some user
  groups using the same script (in this case Latin). The recommended way to
  implement locale-based searching based on sorting tables is found in [<a href="tr30-2.html#Collation">Collation</a>].</p>
  <h4>5.1.7 Compatibility decompositions</h4>
  <p>Compatibility decomposition provides a fixed combination of several
  foldings and expansions. It is in fact the source of most of the foldings in
  the table in section 4.0. There are two ways to subdivide compatibility
  decompositions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>by compatibility decomposition type (the value in &lt;&gt; in the date
      file, e.g. &lt;super&gt;)</li>
    <li>by explicitly limiting the range of <i>source</i> characters</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The specifications in <a href="tr30-2.html#_Toc5">Section 5.0</a> uses the first method, whenever the     
  compatibility tag is well defined and meaningful. Where it is too broad, e.g.,     
  for the&nbsp; &lt;compat&gt; tag, foldings are further subdivided by defining     
  specific ranges of source characters.</p>     
  <p>Using compatibility decomposition is convenient, since existing algorithms
  for Normalization may provide them. However, the full decomposition includes
  several foldings that may not be appropriate for the given purpose. By
  selectively not applying the decomposition to certain character ranges given
  in Section 4.0, one can in effect limit the compatibility decomposition to
  only the desired foldings.</p>
  <h3><a name="_Toc52">5.2 Problematic foldings or expansions</a></h3>
  <p>Some foldings can have unintended consequences, including inadvertent
  changes in the semantics of the text. In most cases, it is best to be
  conservative and avoid problematic foldings altogether. There are two general
  exceptions to this rule. The first is the case of identifier matching. If a
  folding has a prohibited character as one of the output characters, it will
  not match any legal identifier. Therefore, for properly restricted inputs, one
  may safely use fixed combinations of foldings, such as NFKC. The other
  exception is the case of more extensive string pre-processing, discussed
  below.</p>
  <h4>5.2.1 Fraction expansion</h4>
  <p>Fraction expansion as defined in the compatibility decompositions can lead     
  to a drastic change of the semantics of a string and can lead to term boundary     
  issues for searching. For example:&nbsp; Expanding the fraction in this     
  string: DIGIT 5 + VULGAR FRACTION ONE QUARTER&nbsp; turns it into DIGIT 5 +     
  DIGIT 1 + FRACTION SLASH + DIGIT 4. This now will be found by a search for     
  &quot;51&quot;. Because of the semantics of FRACTION SLASH the expansion     
  changed the numeric value from &quot;5 and a quarter&quot; into &quot;51 over     
  4&quot;. Fraction expansion is therefore best avoided altogether.</p>     
  <p>By modifying the fraction expansion from the standard compatibility
  decomposition and inserting an appropriate space character, for example THIN
  SPACE, before the fraction, it is possible to prevent the expanded fraction
  from coalescing with preceding digits. However, if there are no preceding
  digits, no THIN SPACE must be added, or strings containing the expanded
  fraction would no longer match strings with already expanded fractions which
  presumably would not contain THIN SPACE characters. Finally, any space
  character would be subject to any space folding, which, if present would
  introduce a SPACE character, possibly affecting the search term.</p>
  <h4>5.2.2 Bullet expansions</h4>
  <p>If a circled bullet character is simply replaced by its contents, as when<i>&nbsp;</i>     
  CIRCLED DIGIT 5 is replaced by DIGIT 5, the separation from the surrounding     
  text is lost, and the DIGIT 5 could run together with adjacent numbers. For     
  bullet characters using parenthesized or dotted letters or digit, this issue     
  is somewhat mitigated by fact that the bullet itself contains punctuation.     
  Bullet characters are commonly used like footnote marks to refer to other     
  text, in other words, they do not occur just at the beginning of bulleted     
  lines.</p>
  <h4>5.2.3 Spacing accents substitution</h4>
  <p>Spacing accents are mapped by compatibility decomposition to SPACE followed
  by a non-spacing accent. This inappropriately introduces a space character
  into the term, as well as introducing non-spacing marks where none were in the
  data before. The former is especially problematic, where the matching
  operation is affected by these spaces and combining characters.</p>
  <h4>5.2.4 Math folding</h4>
  <p>The set of compatibility decompositions includes the folding of letterlike
  mathematical symbols to their nearest ASCII or Hebrew equivalent. In
  particular the Hebrew characters used as letterlike symbols do not have RIGHT
  TO LEFT directionality and the set of such letters in mathematical usage is
  sufficiently restricted that such folding makes little sense in math, except
  in pure 'looks like' style searches.</p>
  <h4>5.2.5 Various &quot;cluster&quot; expansions</h4>
  <p>Unicode contains many clusters, <i>e.g.</i> square symbols, some of the
  letterlike characters that are made up of several characters. 'Decomposing'
  these may or may not be the right thing for search equivalence. Parenthesized
  characters and numbers would probably be immune to the term boundaries issues
  raised earlier, but the story is less clear for others.</p>
  <h4>5.2.5 Jamo expansion</h4>
  <p>For more information on Jamo expansion see Section 11.4 <i> Hangul</i> in [<a href="tr30-2.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
  <h4>5.2.6 Preserving semantics</h4>
  <p>To a limited extent, the problems surrounding bullet expansion can be
  mitigated by inserting a THIN SPACE around the expansion to set the expanded
  text off from the surrounding text. However, this cannot be applied together
  with any space folding, as otherwise the THIN SPACE may become SPACE and might
  be considered a search term delimiter.</p>
