  <h2><a name="_Toc1"></a>1 Scope</h2>
  <p>This report identifies a set of character foldings, in other words,
  operations that map similar characters to a common target. 
	<span class="changed"
>Folding operations are most often
  used to temporarily </span>ignore certain distinctions between similar characters. 
	For example, they are are useful
  for &quot;fuzzy&quot; or &quot;loose&quot; searches.
	<span class="changed"
>More rarely, certain folding 
	operations may be used to permanently remove distinctions.</span> Each
  of the folding operations specified in this report has well-understood
  properties, and is appropriate in specific contexts. For example some
  identifiers need case folding, some do not. Some text searches need to
  preserve superscript forms such as the <i>trademark symbol </i>™, while
  others do not. For those and similar reasons, not all of these folding operations may be appropriate in a
  given context. See <a href="tr30-3.html#_Toc52">Section 5.2</a> for some of the more
  problematic folding or expansion operations.</p>
  <p>The report also a provides an algorithm for combining these operations for
  the purpose of searching or programmatic identifier matching. 
	<span class="changed"
>This algorithm combines</span>
  canonical normalization with optional folding operations. This allows
  implementers to decide which folding option is useful for a particular
  purpose.</p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc2">2 </a>Introduction</h2>
  A folding function a folding operation removes a distinction
  between related characters by mapping them to the same target.&nbsp; For example,
  a case folding may removes the case distinction, by replacing
    upper and title case variants of a character with the lower case. In other
  words, foldings define equivalence classes, and chose a representative or
  target member for each equivalence class. Applying a folding maps all members 
	of the equivalence class to the target.<p>
	<span class="changed"
>Repeatedly applying the same folding 
	does not change the result, a property called idempotency. Since foldings 
	remove distinctions, they lose information. For that reason it is not 
	possible to construct an inverse operation, except in the trivial case of an 
	identity folding.</span></p>
	<p>
	<span class="changed">Foldings have a domain of operation. All characters 
	not in this domain are left unchanged. Two foldings that otherwise perform 
	the same operation are distinct if their domain of operation is different.</span></p>
	<p>Foldings can be applied transiently, for
  example the same folding can be applied to two strings before comparison, or
  they can be used to permanently transform a text, for example when applying
  the Positional Forms Folding to converting legacy data that uses explicit
  Arabic positional shapes to the generic Arabic characters with implicit
  directionality.</p>
	<p><span class="changed"
>In a more general sense, the 
	elements of equivalence classes or the target of a folding may be character 
	sequences, such as combining character sequences. An example 
	are the Katakana foldings where voiced syllables are written with two 
	characters for halfwidth Katakana and single characters otherwise (<b>ｶ</b>
	<b>+</b> <b>ﾞ</b> <b>→</b> <b>ガ</b>). A character may be folded differently 
	when it is part of different character sequences or when it is by itself. 
	This means that foldings in general are context sensitive. Finally, the 
	output of a folding operation, whether context sensitive or not, may result 
	in a string that is longer or shorter than the input string.</span></p>
	<p>For formal definitions of string and folding functions and their 
	classification see UTR #23, <i>
	<a href="../tr23.1">Unicode Character Property Model</a></i> [<a href="tr30-3.html#PropModel">PropModel</a>]</p>
  <h3><a name="_Toc21">2.1 Search Term Folding</a></h3>
  <p>For the purpose of fuzzy text matching, including both programmatic
  identifier matching and general text searching, it is often necessary to
  selectively ignore otherwise meaningful distinctions between related
  characters, for example upper and lower case, 
	<span class="changed"
>presence</span> of accent marks, etc.
  This process can be called <i>search term folding</i>. Depending on the
  <span class="changed"
>search</span> operation, different foldings need to be applied, and possible interactions
	<span class="changed"
>between foldings and between folded 
	characters and adjacent text that is not folded</span>
  must be carefully managed, <span class="changed"
>as they can 
	affect the result of the search and introduce both</span> false positive or false negative matches.
	<span class="changed"
>The remainder of the document 
	describes various foldings and discusses their use in the context of search 
	term folding.</span></p>
  <p>A significant aspect of string foldings for programmatic <i>identifier matching</i>
  is that the set of allowable <span class="changed"
>
	identifier</span> characters is restricted. Issues that relate to identifier matching in
  particular are addressed
  specifically below.</p>
  <h3><a name="_Toc22">2.2 Relation to Normalization</a></h3>
  <p>Normalization [<a href="tr30-3.html#Normalization">Normalization</a>] is part of any
  robust search term folding algorithm (see section <a href="tr30-3.html#_Toc411">Section 4.1.1
  <i>Basic Folding Algorithm</i></a>).&nbsp;
  However, there are some important differences between normalization and the
  foldings that make up search term folding. Normalization, particular the
  <i>canonical</i> forms (NFC or NFD) are often
  intended for permanent transformation of data,&nbsp; while search term 
	<span class="changed"
>and other foldings </span>are by nature transient. Further, unlike 
	<span class="changed"
>most of</span> the other foldings considered here,
  normalization it is not context-independent, since the equivalences are not
  between characters, but character sequences.</p>
  <p> As defined, the normalization forms offer only two broad
  levels of distinctions (they either preserve or do not preserve compatibility
  distinctions).&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice of which distinctions may be ignored for search term folding
  needs to be more specific; it depends on the nature of the operation. One size
  does not fit all.</p>
  <p>For example, two of the normalization forms depend on compatibility
  mappings which replace character by their compatibility decompositions.
  Applying certain of these compatibility mappings may lead to unintended false
  positive matches, preventing their use in general text searches. In
  combination with whole word search it could even lead to unintended false
  negatives. (See <a href="tr30-3.html#_Toc52">Section 5.2 <i>Problematical foldings</i></a>).</p>
  <p>Furthermore, normalization and case folding are defined as separate and
  independent operations, but&nbsp; case folding often occurs together with
  other foldings in search term folding. In order to avoid inconsistencies,
  search term folding needs to address the interaction of case folding with the
  other steps in the algorithm.</p>
  <p>Search term folding includes canonical normalization; however, whether the
  normalized text is in the composed (NFC) or decomposed form (NFD) is of
  secondary importance in terms of defining the foldings. Due to the transient
  nature of search term folding, the distinction between NFC and NFD is
  immaterial, as long as the two forms are not mixed.&nbsp;However, if the data 
	is known to be in one of the normalized forms, it would be computationally 
	less expensive to operate the search in that form.</p>
  <h3><a name="_Toc23">2.3 Relation to Collation</a></h3>
  <p>Like foldings, the comparisons at
  the heart of the <a href="../tr10/index.html">Unicode
  Collation Algorithm</a> [<a href="tr30-3.html#UCA">UCA</a>] also define equivalences. One can derive a
  specific folding by applying the collation algorithm with a particular
  strength and specific tailorings. Foldings derived in this manner can be useful in
  searches that ignore similar distinctions to those ignored in collation. Such
  foldings are not subject of this report.</p>

  <h3><a name="_Toc41">4.1 Folding algorithm</a></h3>
  <h4><a name="_Toc411">4.1.1 Basic Folding Algorithm</a></h4>
  <p>The basic algorithm for search term folding can be stated as</p>
  <p>a. Apply optional&nbsp; folding operations<br>
  b. Apply canonical decomposition<br>
  c. Repeat (<b>a</b>) and (<b>b</b>) until stable<br>
  d. Apply composition if necessary</p>
  <p>where each step is applied on the whole string, and applies to the result 
	of the preceding operation. </p>
  <h4><a name="_Toc412">4.1.2 Identifier Folding algorithm</a></h4>
  <p>For identifier folding, it is important to account for prohibited
  characters. This adds a new step (<b>e</b>). The modified basic algorithm then
  becomes:</p>
  <p>a. Apply optional&nbsp; folding operations&nbsp;<br>
  b. Apply canonical decomposition<br>
  c. Repeat (<b>a</b>) and (<b>b</b>) until stable<br>
  d. Apply composition if necessary<br>
  e. Eliminate or flag forbidden characters</p>
  <p>Foldings in step (<b>a</b>) can be modified to also disallow certain characters by
  mapping them to forbidden characters, which are then caught in step (<b>e</b>). </p>

  <h2><a name="_Toc5">5 Notes and Guidelines</a></h2>
  <h3><a name="_Toc51">5.1 General notes</a></h3>
  <p>The most important guideline is &quot;discriminate&quot;. Understand the
  effect before applying a folding. Do not apply any of these folding all at
  once just because it exists, and certainly never all of them at once. The
  following notes on individual foldings or issues may be of help in following
  this guideline.</p>
  <h4>5.1.1 Case folding</h4>
  <p>The [<a href="tr30-3.html#CaseFolding">CaseFolding</a>] data file provides case
  folding information. For more information see Section 5.18 <i>Case
  Mappings</i> in [<a href="tr30-3.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
  <h4>5.1.2 Diacritic folding</h4>
  <p>Diacritic folding goes beyond the decomposition and removal of accents,
  umlauts, cedillas etc. that is provided by the canonical decompositions,
  but&nbsp; also includes barred, slashed forms etc, as well as hooks,
  descenders, etc.</p>
  <h4>5.1.3 Letter forms</h4>
  <p>Greek letter forms should be folded for Greek text. They should <b>not</b>
  be folded for mathematical and scientific usage as doing so would conflate
  very distinct concepts. To give an example of common usage consider physics,
  which distinguishes angle encoded by <i>theta</i> <i>"θ"</i> and temperature encoded by <i>theta
  symbol</i> <i>"ϑ"</i>.</p>
	<p><span class="changed"
>The compatibility decompositions contain only a subset of variant letter forms 
	that could be folded for search purposes, including <i>Greek final sigma</i> 
	and <i>Latin long s</i>.</span></p>
	<p><span class="changed"><i>Greek final sigma</i> should </span><b>
	<span class="changed"
>not</span></b><span 
 class="changed"
> be folded, unless transiently. <i>Latin long s</i> should be folded for 
	modern text in roman type style but, other than transiently for searches, 
	should not be folded for texts intended to be set in Fraktur type. Other 
	letterform foldings include alternate Hebrew characters.</span></p>
  <h4>5.1.4 Han Character Foldings</h4>
  <p><span class="changed"
>There are a number of foldings 
	applicable to Han Ideographs. While the Unicode Consortium has not yet 
	published any datafile defining these, they can be described in general 
	terms.</span></p>
	<h5>Han Radical folding</h5>
  <p>Han Radical folding substitutes a Unified ideograph for a Han radical.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Note that the existing compatibility decomposition for Han Radicals is inconsistent and should
      not be used for Radical folding.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Simplified / traditional folding</h5>
  <p>Simplified and traditional forms of Han ideographs are separately encoded
  in Unicode, even where they represent the same meaning. This folding would
  remove the distinction. In practice, there are additional differences in Han
  character usage between writers of simplified and traditional Han ideographs,
  some of which cannot be folded without context and semantic information. A
  simple 1:1folding is nevertheless useful for many purposes.</p>
  <h5>Variant folding</h5>
  <p>As results of historical development of the Han ideograph there are
  multiple variations of characters for the same concept, for example there are
  47 variants for 'turtle'. Such folding would remove such variations. The
  process of defining such a folding for all such cases will be difficult and
  lengthy.</p>
  <h5>Source separation foldings</h5>
  <p>The Unicode Standard maintains duplications for certain Han ideographs
  based on the fact that they were separately encoded <i>within</i> a given
  source character set. A Han source separation folding would equivalence such
  separated characters.</p>
  <h4>5.1.4 Kana Foldings</h4>
  <p>Japanese Katakana and Hiragana are two generally equivalent syllabaries,
  where each Hiragana syllable has a corresponding Katakana syllable. Foldings
  in both directions are useful, depending on the situation. However,
  since Katakana are used to represent the pronunciation of foreign words in
  Japanese, there are more Katakana than Hiragana characters.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There is one important difference in orthography between the syllabaries,
  affecting the way the long syllables are expressed. Hiragana uses an
  additional vowel, while Katakana uses a length mark. If this is taken into
  account, the folding is no longer context free. In fact, these are better seen
  as examples of algorithmic transliterations, such as the ISCII
  transliterations between Indic scripts.</p>
	<p><span class="changed"
>In addition, Katakana occur in 
	both regular and halfwidth forms, with the halfwidth forms using two 
	characters to express voiced or semi-voiced syllables, where the regular 
	Katakana use a single character. The [<a href="tr30-3.html#HiraganaFolding">HiraganaFolding</a>] 
	merely folds Hiragana to regular Katakana, while the [<a 
 href="tr30-3.html#KatakanaFolding">KatakanaFolding</a>] folds both halfwidth and regular 
	Katakana characters to Hiragana.</span></p>
	<h4><span class="changed"
>5.1.5 Syllabic vowel foldings</span></h4>
	<p><span class="changed"
>Ethiopic is an example of an &quot;open alphasyllabary&quot; where a single symbol 
	represents a CV (consonant + vowel) pattern. In principle, such a syllabary 
	has several forms for each consonant C: one for each of the vowels V, and one 
	vowel-less form. However, not all forms are actually used in a given syllabary.</span></p>
	<p><span class="changed"
>Vowels often appear in the wrong 
	form in electronic text due to typographical errors (<i>e.g.</i> from 
	incompatible input methods), different spelling conventions, or where grammatical 
	word inflections are primarily expressed by a change of vowel, as it the 
	case for Ethiopic. In such situations it may make sense to fold away the 
	vowel by converting all syllables in a string that have the same consonant 
	into a common reference form.</span></p>
	<p><span class="changed"
>The choice of reference form depends on the syllabary, or more precisely on 
	features of the languages that are using the syllabary. For 
	Ethiopic, a vowel-less form has been found to be the most practical target 
	for folding. </span></p>
	<p><span class="changed">For other syllabaries, vowel folding may not be as 
	useful.</span></p>
  <h4>5.1.6 Semantically neutral foldings</h4>
  <p>Semantically neutral foldings could be defined as those foldings that
  simply remove a distinction that is more or less purely an artifact of the
  encoding itself. Under the right circumstances, these foldings are in
  principle candidates for permanent data transformation. This is primarily true for the canonical decomposition and composition, but could also
  apply to text using the Arabic positional forms. If such a text is converted
  to use non-positional forms, but rendered via a standard Unicode rendering
  process, the appearance would be the same (except for deliberately odd
  combinations of positional shapes). In practice it is far more likely that the
  data containing the positional forms will display poorly on a system that
  expects characters with implicit positional shaping.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The following foldings can be considered semantically neutral</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Arabic positional forms folding</li>
    <li>Vertical forms folding</li>
    <li>Canonical decomposition and composition, excepting Han compatibility
      characters.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that Arabic positional folding, especially when intended as a
  permanent data transformation, may need to introduce ZWJ or ZWNJ characters.</p>
  <h4><i>5.1.7 Foldings based on tailored collation data</i></h4>
  <p>Foldings based on tailored collation data would fold characters that are
  'nearly equivalent' in a particular language. For example, a locale-based
  folding for Swedish could follow common practice in Sweden and match the
  following pairs of character sequences, among others, based on equivalence in
  pronunciation.</p>
  <table border="1" width="30%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">

      </td>
      <td width="25%" align="center" height="18">
        <p align="center">w</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>In other words, locale-based foldings would be different for some user
  groups using the same script (in this case Latin). The recommended way to
  implement locale-based searching based on sorting tables is found in [<a href="tr30-3.html#UCA
">UCA
</a>].</p>
  <h4>5.1.8 Compatibility decompositions</h4>
  <p>Compatibility decomposition provides a fixed combination of several
  foldings and expansions. It is in fact the source of most of the foldings in
  the table in section 4.0. There are two ways to subdivide compatibility
  decompositions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>by compatibility decomposition type (the value in &lt;&gt; in [<a 
 href="tr30-3.html#UnicodeData">UnicodeData</a>], e.g. &lt;super&gt;)</li>
    <li>by explicitly limiting the range of <i>source</i> characters</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The specifications in <a href="tr30-3.html#_Toc5">Section 5.0</a> uses the first method, whenever the
  compatibility tag is well defined and meaningful. Where it is too broad, e.g.,
  for the&nbsp; &lt;compat&gt; tag, foldings are further subdivided by defining
  specific ranges of source characters.</p>
  <p>Using compatibility decomposition is convenient, since existing algorithms
  for Normalization may provide them. However, the full decomposition includes
  several foldings that may not be appropriate for the given purpose. By
  selectively not applying the decomposition to certain character ranges given
  in Section 4.0, one can in effect limit the compatibility decomposition to
  only the desired foldings.</p>
  <h3><a name="_Toc52">5.2 Problematic foldings or expansions</a></h3>
  <p>Some foldings can have unintended consequences, including inadvertent
  changes in the semantics of the text. In most cases, it is best to be
  conservative and avoid problematic foldings altogether. There are two general
  exceptions to this rule. The first is the case of identifier matching. If a
  folding has a prohibited character as one of the output characters, it will
  not match any legal identifier. Therefore, for properly restricted inputs, one
  may safely use fixed combinations of foldings, such as NFKC. The other
  exception is the case of more extensive string pre-processing, discussed
  below.</p>
  <h4>5.2.1 Fraction expansion</h4>
  <p>Fraction expansion as defined in the compatibility decompositions can lead
  to a drastic change of the semantics of a string and can lead to term boundary
  issues for searching. For example:&nbsp; Expanding the fraction in this
  string: &lt;DIGIT 5, VULGAR FRACTION ONE QUARTER&gt;&nbsp; turns it into &lt;DIGIT 5,
  DIGIT 1, FRACTION SLASH, DIGIT 4&gt;. This now will be found by a search for
  &quot;51&quot;. Because of the semantics of FRACTION SLASH the expansion
  also changes the numeric value from &quot;5 and a quarter&quot; into &quot;51 over
  4&quot;. Fraction expansion is therefore best avoided altogether.</p>
  <p>By modifying the fraction expansion from the standard compatibility
  decomposition and inserting an appropriate space character, for example THIN
  SPACE, before the fraction, it is possible to prevent the expanded fraction
  from coalescing with preceding digits. However, if there are no preceding
  digits, no THIN SPACE must be added, or strings containing the expanded
  fraction would no longer match strings with already expanded fractions which
  presumably would not contain THIN SPACE characters. Finally, any space
  character would be subject to <i>space folding</i>, which, if present would
  introduce a SPACE character, possibly affecting the search term.</p>
  <h4>5.2.2 Bullet expansions</h4>
  <p>If a circled bullet character is simply replaced by its contents, as when<i>&nbsp;</i>
  CIRCLED DIGIT 5 is replaced by DIGIT 5, the separation from the surrounding
  text is lost, and the DIGIT 5 could run together with adjacent numbers. For
  bullet characters using parenthesized or dotted letters or digit, this issue
  is somewhat mitigated by fact that the bullet itself contains punctuation.
  Bullet characters are commonly used like footnote marks to refer to other
  text, in other words, they do not occur just at the beginning of bulleted
  lines.</p>
  <h4>5.2.3 Spacing accents substitution</h4>
  <p>Spacing accents are mapped by compatibility decomposition to SPACE followed
  by a non-spacing accent. This inappropriately introduces a space character
  into the term, as well as introducing non-spacing marks where none were in the
  data before. The former is especially problematic, where the matching
  operation is affected by these spaces and combining characters.</p>
  <h4>5.2.4 Math folding</h4>
  <p>The set of compatibility decompositions includes the folding of letterlike
  mathematical symbols to their nearest ASCII or Hebrew equivalent. In
  particular the Hebrew characters used as letterlike symbols do not have RIGHT
  TO LEFT directionality and the set of such letters in mathematical usage is
  sufficiently restricted that such folding makes little sense in math, except
  in pure 'looks like' style searches.</p>
  <h4>5.2.5 Various &quot;cluster&quot; expansions</h4>
  <p>Unicode contains many clusters, <i>e.g.</i> square symbols, some of the
  letterlike characters that are made up of several characters. 'Decomposing'
  these may or may not be the right thing for search equivalence. Parenthesized
  characters and numbers would probably be immune to the term boundaries issues
  raised earlier, but the story is less clear for others.</p>
  <h4>5.2.5 Jamo expansion</h4>
  <p>For more information on Jamo expansion see Section 11.4 <i> Hangul</i> in [<a href="tr30-3.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
  <h4>5.2.6 Preserving semantics</h4>
  <p>To a limited extent, the problems surrounding bullet expansion can be
  mitigated by inserting a THIN SPACE around the expansion to set the expanded
  text off from the surrounding text. However, this cannot be applied together
  with any space folding, as otherwise the THIN SPACE may become SPACE and might
  be considered a search term delimiter.</p>
	<h3><a name="_Toc53">5.3 Versioning and stability</a></h3>
	<p><span class="changed"
>As characters are added to [<a 
 href="tr30-3.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] many of them need to be added to the definition of 
	foldings described here. However, there are some exceptions, for example, few 
	characters subject to [<a href="tr30-3.html#WidthFolding">WidthFolding</a>] are 
	expected to be added. The datafiles that are specifically associated with 
	this Technical Report contain a note discussing the expected level and type 
	of future changes.</span></p>
	<p><span class="changed"
>No attempt is made to version the datafiles associated with this 
	Technical Report. Each version replaces the preceding version. Each File 
	will indicate which version of the Unicode Standard is required to cover all 
	character codes referred to. In 
	order to recover folding tables for earlier versions of the Standard, simply 
	delete any lines that refer to any characters (whether as source or 
	target characters) for which the [</span><a href="tr30-3.html#DerivedAge"><span 
 class="changed"
>DerivedAge</span></a><span 
 class="changed"
>] is 
	more recent than the desired version.</span></p>
	<p><span class="changed">Where significant changes have been made to the folding data for existing characters 
	they are noted 
	in the change history in each data file.</span></p>
	<p><span class="changed"
>Foldings derived from data in the Unicode Character Database [</span><a 
 href="tr30-3.html#UCD"><span class="changed"
>UCD</span></a><span 
 class="changed"

	datafiles that are originally associated with this Technical Report may be 
	incorporated into the UCD.</span></p>
