<h2><a name="Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The Unicode Standard  [<a href="tr20-4.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] is the universal
character set. Its primary goal is to provide an unambiguous encoding of the
content of plain text, ultimately covering all languages in the world.
Currently in its third major version, Unicode contains a large number of
characters covering most of the currently used scripts in the world. It also
contains additional characters for interoperability with older character
encodings, and characters with control-like functions included primarily for
reasons of providing unambiguous interpretation of plain text. Unicode
provides specifications for use of all of these characters.</p>

<p>For document and data interchange, the Internet and the World Wide Web are
more and more making use of marked-up text such as <a href="tr20-4.html#html40">HTML</a>
and <a href="tr20-4.html#xml10">XML</a>. In many instances, markup provides the same, or
essentially similar features to those provided by format characters in the
Unicode Standard for use in plain text. Another special character category
provided by Unicode are compatibility characters. While there may be valid
reasons to support these characters and their specifications in plain text,
their use in marked-up text can conflict with the rules of the markup
language. Formatting characters are discussed in chapters <a
href="tr20-4.html#General">2</a> and <a href="tr20-4.html#Charlist">3</a>, compatibility characters
in chapter <a href="tr20-4.html#Compatibility">4</a>.</p>

<p>The issues of using Unicode characters with marked-up text depend to some
degree on the rules of the markup language in question and the set of elements
it contains. In a narrow sense, this document concerns itself only with XML,
and to some extent HTML. However, much of the general information presented
here should be useful in a broader context, including some page layout
languages.</p>

<h3>1.1 Notation</h3>

<p>This report uses XML [<a href="tr20-4.html#xml10">XML</a>] as a prominent and general
example of markup. The XML namespace notation [<a
href="tr20-4.html#Namespace">Namespace</a>] is used to indicate that a certain element is
taken from a specific markup language. As an example, the prefix 'html:'
indicates that this element is taken from [<a href="tr20-4.html#XHTML">XHTML</a>]. This
means that the examples containing the namespace prefix 'html:' are assumed to
include a namespace declaration of xmlns:html="..." </p>

<p>Characters are denoted using the notation used in the Unicode Standard,
i.e. U+ followed by their hexadecimal number, using at least 4 digits, such as
"U+1234" or "U+10FFFD". In XML or HTML this could be expressed as
"&amp;#x1234;" or "&amp;#x10FFFD;". </p>

<h2><a name="General">2. General Considerations</a></h2>

<p>There are several general points to consider when looking at the
interaction between character encoding and markup. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Linearity of text vs. hierarchy of markup structure</li>
  <li>Overlap of control codes and markup semantics</li>
  <li>Coincidence of semantic markup and functions </li>
  <li>Extensibility of markup</li>
  <li>Markup <i> vs.</i> Styling</li>
</ul>

<h3 align="left">2.1 Linearity versus Structure</h3>

<p align="left">Encoding text as a sequence of characters without further
information leads to a linear sequence, commonly called plain text. Character
follows character, without any particular structure. Markup, on the other
hand, defines a hierarchical structure for the text or data. In the case of
XML and most other, similar markup languages, the markup defines a tree
structure. While this tree structure is linearized for transmission in the XML
document, once the document has been parsed, the tree is available
directly.</p>

<p align="left">Operations that are easy to perform on trees are often
difficult to perform on linear sequences and vice versa. By separating
functionality between character encoding and markup appropriately, the
architecture becomes simpler, more powerful and longer-lasting.</p>

<p align="left">In particular, operations on hierarchical structures can
easily make sure that information is kept in context. Attributes assigned to
parts of a document are moved together with the associated part of the
document. Assigning an attribute to a part of a document limits the scope of
the attribute to that part of the document. Performing the same operations on
linear sequences of characters using control codes to set attributes and to
delimit their scope requires much more work and is error prone. Locating the
start or end of a span of text of the same attribute requires scanning
backwards and forwards for the embedded delimiter or control code. Moving or
editing text often results in mismatched control codes, so that an attribute
might suddenly apply to text it was not intended for.</p>

<h3 align="left">2.2 Overlap of Control Code and Markup Semantics</h3>

<p align="left">When markup is not available, plain text may require control
characters. This is usually the case where plain text must contain some
scoping or attribute information in order to be legible, <i>i.e.</i> to be
able to transmit the same content between originator and receiver. Many of
these control characters have direct equivalents in particular markup
languages, since markup handles these concerns efficiently. If both characters
and their markup equivalents may be present in the same text, the question of
priority is raised: Which of the settings has priority and in which case?
Therefore it is important to identify and resolve these ambiguities at the
time markup is first applied.</p>

<h3 align="left">2.3 Markup and Styling</h3>

<p align="left">Besides the basic character encoding and text markup there is
a third contributor to text functionality, namely styling. Markup is concerned
with the logical structure of the text or data, <i>e.g. </i>to indicate
sections, subsections, and headers in a document, or to indicate the various
fields of an address record. Styling is used to present the information in
various ways, <i>e.g.</i> in different fonts, different type styles (italic,
bold), different colors, <i>etc.. </i>Some character codes do not encode a
generic character, but a styled character. Where these characters are used,
styling information is frozen, <i>i.e.</i> it is no longer possible to alter
the appearance of the text by applying style information. However, there are
many examples where a historically free stylistic variation has over time
become a semantic distinction that is properly encoded as plain text. In such
instances, altering the appearance of the text by styling information would
irreparably alter the content of the text.</p>

<h3 align="left">2.4 Coincidence of Markup and Functions</h3>

<p align="left">Dealing with various functionalities on the markup level has
the additional advantage that in most cases, text portions that need some
particular attribute (or styling) are actually those text portions identified
by markup. A paragraph may be in French, a citation may need a bidi embedding,
a keyword may be in italics, a list number may be circled, <i>etc.</i>. This
makes it very efficient to associate those attributes with markup.</p>

<h3 align="left">2.5 Extensibility of Markup</h3>

<p align="left">Character encoding works with a range of integers used as
character codes. This is extremely efficient, but has some limitations. Markup
on the other hand, is much more extensible. Using technologies such as [<a
href="tr20-4.html#Namespace">Namespace</a>] various vocabularies can be mixed. This is
important for functionality that depends on complex context.</p>

<h3 align="left">2.6 Local Context</h3>

<p align="left">Where local, or point like context is required, markup is not
very efficient and its main benefit, easy manipulation of scope, is not
required. On the contrary, the intrusion of markup in the middle of words can
make search or sort operations more difficult. For these cases expressing the
information as character codes is not only a viable, but often the preferred
alternative, which needs to be considered in the design of markup
languages.</p>

<h2><a name="Charlist">3. List of Characters</a></h2>

<h3>3. 1 List of discouraged characters</h3>

<p>There are characters whose use in the context of markup in XML/HTML should
be considered discouraged, because one or more of the following conditions
apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are deprecated in the Unicode Standard.</li>
  <li>They are unsupportable without additional information.</li>
  <li>They are undesirable because of conflict with equivalent markup.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following table contains the characters currently considered <b> not
suitable</b> for use with markup in XML/HTML, and may also be unsuitable for
other markup or page layout languages. </p>

<p>Except for Line and Paragraph Separator and the characters in table 3.2 it
is <i>always</i> acceptable for user agents to ignore the presence of
discouraged characters in HTML or XML. It is up to authoring tools to ensure
proper conversion between these characters and equivalent markup where it
exists. The recommendations use markup available in HTML. For XML, the
character can be replaced if the DTD permits.</p>

<h3>3.3 Line and Paragraph Separator, U+2028..U+2029</h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: The line and paragraph separator provide
unambiguous means to denote hard line breaks and paragraph delimiters in plain
text.</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters were introduced into the
Unicode Standard to overcome the ambiguous and widely divergent use of control
codes for this purpose. See Unicode Technical Report #13, Unicode Newline
Guidelines <a href="tr20-4.html#UTR9">[UTR13]</a>.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Including these characters in markup
text does not work because it would duplicate the existing markup commands for
delimiting paragraphs and lines.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The separator characters can also
problematic when used in plain text, because legacy data is usually converted
code point for code point into Unicode and all receivers of Unicode plain text
have to effectively be able to interpret the existing use of control codes for
this purpose.</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: Use &lt;html:br /> instead of U+2028 and
surround paragraphs by &lt;html:p> and &lt;/html:p> instead of separating them
with U+2029.</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: In a browser context, treat as whitespace.
When received in an editing context, replace the character by the
corresponding markup. </p>

<h3>3.4 BIDI embedding controls (LRE, RLE, LRO, RLO, PDF), U+202A ..
U+202E</h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: The BIDI embedding controls are required to
supplement the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm in plain text</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: The Unicode Bidirectional algorithm
unambiguously resolves the display direction for bidirectional text. It does
so, by assigning all characters directional categories and then resolving
these in context. In a small number of circumstances this <i>implicit </i>
method does not produce satisfactory results and embedding controls are needed
to ensure that sender and receiver agree on the display direction for a given
text. See Unicode Technical Report # 9, The Bidirectional Algorithm <a
href="tr20-4.html#UTR9">[UTR 9]</a>.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters duplicate available
markup, which is better suited to handle the stateful nature of their
effect. </p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The embedding controls introduce a state
into the plain text, which must be maintained editing or displaying the text.
Processes that are modifying the text without being aware of this state may
inadvertently affect the rendering of large portions of the text, for example
by removing a PDF.</p>

markup:<br>

<p>For details on bidi markup, please see Section 8.2 of HTML [<a
href="tr20-4.html#HTML4.0-8.2">HMTL 4.0-8.2</a>]. The text of HTML 4.0 gives this
recommendation: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Using HTML directionality markup with Unicode
  characters.</strong> Authors and designers of authoring software should be
  aware that conflicts can arise if the <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#adef-dir"
  class="noxref"><samp class="ainst">dir</samp></a> attribute is used on
  inline elements (including <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#edef-BDO"

  corresponding<a rel="biblioentry" href="tr20-4.html#Unicode" class="normref">
  [UNICODE]</a> formatting characters. Preferably one or the other should be
  used exclusively. The markup method offers a better guarantee of document
  structural integrity and alleviates some problems when editing bidirectional
  HTML text with a simple text editor, but some software may be more apt at
  using the<a rel="biblioentry" href="tr20-4.html#Unicode" class="normref"> [UNICODE]</a>
  characters. If both methods are used, great care should be exercised to
  insure proper nesting of markup and directional embedding or override,
  otherwise, rendering results are undefined.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This document goes beyond HTML and recommends that <i>only</i> the markup
should be used.</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: In a browser context, ignore. When
received in an editing context, replace the characters by the appropriate
markup. </p>

<h3>3.5<em> </em>Deprecated Formatting Characters, U+206A..U+206F</h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: These characters are deprecated. They were
originally intended to allow explicit activation of contextual shaping,
numeric digit rendering and symmetric swapping.</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters were retained from draft
versions of ISO 10646.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: The processing model for these
characters is not supported in markup.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The Unicode Standard requires that
symmetric swapping, contextual shaping and alternate digit shapes are enabled
by default and no longer supports inhibiting any of them by use of these
character codes. The most likely effect of their occurrence in generated text
would be that of a 'garbage' character.</p>

<p><em>Conversion for use with markup</em>: Apply the appropriate conversion
to bring the data stream in line with the Unicode text model for bidirectional
text and cursively connected scripts.</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: When received by a browser as part of
marked up text, they may be ignored. When received in an editing context, they
may be removed, possibly with a warning. Alternatively, an appropriate
conversion from the legacy text model may be provided. This will most likely
be limited to applications directly interfacing with and knowledgeable of the
particular legacy implementation that inspired these characters.</p>

<h3>3.6 Interlinear Annotation Characters, U+FFF9-U+FFFB</h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: The interlinear annotation characters are used
to delimit interlinear annotations in certain circumstances. They are intended
to provide text anchors and delimiters for interlinear annotation for
in-process use and are not intended for interchange.</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: The interlinear annotation characters were
included in Unicode only in order to reserve code points for very frequent
application-internal use. The interlinear annotation characters are used to
delimit interlinear annotations in contexts where other delimiters are not
available, and where non-textual means exist to carry formatting information.
Many text-processing applications store the text and the associated markup (or
in some cases styling information) of a document in separate structures. The
actual text is kept in a single linear structure; additional information is
kept separately with pointers to the appropriate text positions. This is
called out-of-band information. The overall implementation makes sure that
these two structures are kept in sync. If the text contains interlinear
annotations, it is extremely helpful for implementations to have delimiters in
the text itself; even though delimiters are not otherwise used for style
markup. With this method, and unlike the case of the object replacement
character, all textual information can remain in the standard text stream, but
any additional formatting information is kept separately. In addition, the
Interlinear Annotation Anchor serves as a placeholder for formatting
information for the whole annotation object, the same way a paragraph mark can
be a placeholder to attach paragraph formatting information.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Including interlinear annotation
characters in markup text does not work because the additional formatting
information (how to position the annotation,...) is not available.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The interlinear annotation characters
are also problematic when used in plain text, and are not intended for that
purpose. In particular, on older display systems that simply ignore or replace
the Interlinear Annotation Characters, the meaning of the text may be
changed.</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: The markup to be used in place of the
Interlinear Annotation Characters depends on the formatting and nature of the
interlinear annotation in question. For ruby, please see [<a
href="tr20-4.html#Ruby">Ruby</a>].</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>:  When received by a browser as part of
marked up text, they may be ignored. When receiving plain text in an editing
environment, editor may take one or more of several actions: remove U+FFF9
together with removing all characters between U+FFFA and following U+FFFB, 
ignore U+FFF9 and turn  U+FFFA and  U+FFFB  to "[" and "]" respectively, issue
a warning to the user, or tentatively convert into appropriate ruby markup for
further editing and formatting by the user.</p>

<h3>3.7 Object Replacement Character, U+FFFC</h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: The object replacement character is used to
stand in place of an object (e.g. an image) included in a text.</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: The object replacement character was
included in Unicode only in order to reserve a codepoint for a very frequent
application-internal use. Many text-processing applications store the text and
the associated markup (or in some cases styling information) of a document in
separate structures. The actual text is kept in a single linear structure;
additional information is kept separately with pointers to the appropriate
text positions. The overall implementation makes sure that these two
structures are kept in sync. If the text contains objects such as images, it
is extremely helpful for implementations to have a sentinel in the text
itself; any additional information is kept separately.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Including an object replacement
character in markup text does not work because the additional information
(what object to include,...) is not available.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The object replacement character is also
problematic when used in plain text, because there is no way in plain text to
provide the actual object information or a reference to it.</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: The markup to be used in place of the Object
Replacement Character depends on the object in question and the markup context
it is used in. Typical cases are &lt;html:img src'...' />, &lt;html:object
...>, or &lt;html:applet ...>. These constructs allow providing all additional
information needed to identify and use the object in question.</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: Browsers may ignore this character. When
received in an editing context, if the actual object is accessible, editors
may either replace the character by the appropriate markup for that object, or
otherwise remove it, ideally providing a warning.</p>

<h3>3.8 Language Tag Characters</h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: A series of characters from U+E0000 .. U+E007F
that can be used to express language tags, based on existing standards for
language tags using the rules in [<a href="tr20-4.html#UTR7">UTR7</a>].</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters allow in-band language
tagging in situations where full markup is not available, while allowing easy
filtering by applications that do not support them. They were specifically
included for the benefit of Internet protocols such as ACAP, which require a
standard mechanism for marking language in UTF-8 strings and to avoid the use
of other schemes that relied on specific details of the encoding form
used.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters duplicate
information that can be expressed in markup.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: Their special code range allows them to
be easily filtered, but applications that don't expect them will treat them as
garbage characters.</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: Replace with equivalent language markup
&lt;html:lang></p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: Browsers may ignore these characters. When
received in an editing context, editors may remove and/or replace them by
equivalent markup.</p>

<h2><a name="Compatibility">4. Characters with compatibility mappings</a></h2>

<p>The Unicode Standard provides compatibility mappings for a number of
characters. Compatibility mappings indicate a relationship to another
character, but the exact nature of the relationship varies. In some cases the
relationship means "is based on" in some other cases it denotes a property.
When plain text is marked up, it may make sense to map some of these
characters to their compatibility equivalents <em>and</em> suitable markup. It
is important to understand the nature of the distinctions between characters
and their compatibility equivalents and the context in where these
distinctions matter. It is never advisable to apply compatibility mappings
indiscriminately. This section provides guidance on when and how to apply
compatibility mappings. It is organized by the "compatibility tag" associated
with each compatibility mapping.</p>

<h3>4.1 Overview</h3>

<p>The following table gives an overview of the various compatibility
characters, organized by "compatibility tag". The first column contains the
tag value of the "compatibility tag" from the Unicode database. Although these
tags use "&lt;" and ">", they should not be confused with XML tags. <em>Code
range</em> indicates which code points the entry applies to. <em>Substitute
</em>indicates whether the codes can be substituted using the compatibility
equivalent according to Normalization Form KC of [<a href="tr20-4.html#UTR15">UTR
15</a>]. <em>Markup</em> indicates the available markup. For some cases,
instead of or in addition to markup, style information [<a
href="tr20-4.html#css2">CSS2</a>] is needed. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>*) Use normalization form KC for these particular characters. <br>
  **) Some symbols used in vertical layout may also become accessible via
  bullet style(s).<br>
  ***) At the time of this writing there is no appropriate markup for squared
  kana clusters or horizontal in vertical symbols.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>4.2 Generating characters</h3>

<p>Presentation forms and characters for which adequate representation exists
as marked up text should never be generated for new data. However, many of the
characters with &lt;font> tag are suitable for new data, as long as they are
used in the manner they are intended, that is as symbols, with definite
semantic differentiation between the different forms. They must not be used to
create styled text. On the other hand, styled text should not be used to carry
the essential semantic distinction needed for example for mathematics.</p>

<h3>4.3 Bullets</h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: Characters with a &lt;circled> tag or
characters with &lt;compat> tag and compatibility mapping to a parenthesized
string.</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: They are most frequently used for enumerated
bullets, but the characters with a &lt;circled> tag often occur as dingbats or
footnote markers in tables.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters do not cause undue
interaction with markup</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: None</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: (bullet style) When generating marked up text
these characters occur only internal to the user agent when bullet styles are
rendered. When marking up plain text data they could be converted to suitable
bullet styles, if such use can be properly inferred. However, it is often
necessary to refer to numbered or lettered bullets in the text.</p>

<p>Compatibility mappings of the form (<em>n</em>) or (<em>n</em>.) can be
kept as single characters, or replaced by bullet styles. A conversion to
bullet styles allows a simple extension of the set to arbitrary numbers. This
is in contrast to circled characters: Very few browsers can properly generate
arbitrary circled numbers, therefore conversion to bullet styles does not
easily allow an extension of the set of accessible circled numbers.</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action needs to be taken by browsers.
When received in an editing context, substitution of a bullet style may be
appropriate. However, the same characters are very often used as dingbat-like
symbols in tables, so the user should have the choice of whether to
replace.</p>

<h3>4.4 Fractions</h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: Single character fractions such as ½ or ¼.</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: Subsets of these occur in practically all
legacy character sets.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: The repertoire is limited to a few
common fractions. When used with more general methods of generating fractions
such as MathML[<a href="tr20-4.html#MathML">MathML</a>] the usual problem of dual
representation arises.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: Other than normalization issues, these
characters present no undue problems in plain text. Where fraction slash is
supported, these can be expressed by substituting their compatibility
mappings.</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: MathML.</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action needs to be taken by browsers or
editors.</p>

<h3>4.5 Squared or horizontal</h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: Characters that are symbols composed of groups
of typically kana or Latin letters, digits plus slash for use in a single
display cell in vertical display of text. </p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: Many existing character sets contain these
as precomposed characters since for simple implementations this is the only
way to support the common use of providing metric units and other
abbreviations in a single character cell for vertical text layout. </p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Proposed markup, including CSS
styling, would be able express an unbounded set of these abbreviations,
obviating the need of cataloguing these in the character encoding standard and
making them more directly accessible to text based processing, for example
searching.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The repertoire of these legacy
characters is limited; many more combinations are in actual use than are
accounted for in character sets. Pre-composed symbols do not make their text
content available to search engines. They also require re-encoding for text
laid out horizontally.</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: not available at this time.</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action required.</p>

<h3>4.6 Superscripts and subscripts</h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>:</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: Super and subscript characters occur in many
legacy character sets, including Latin-1. Their use in pure plain text is
common for databases, e.g. including metric units for part descriptions  (viz.
cm<sup>2</sup>) or (usually simplified) formulae as occur in titles of
scientific publications.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Using these characters directly in
markup provides an alternate representation compared to marked up text,
leading to different treatment by search engines.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: none</p>

<h2><a name="Versioning">5. Versioning</a></h2>

<p>This technical report covers all relevant characters in the Unicode
Standard, Version 3.0.</p>

<p>As the Unicode standard is updated and new characters get added, new
characters that are not suitable for markup may also be added. However, the
Unicode Technical Committee only introduces such characters where there is a
strong requirement by industry or users of a script. As markup becomes more
prevalent, the need for such characters may diminish. </p>

<p>This report will be updated by the Unicode Technical Committee in
cooperation with the W3C i18n WG whenever the tables of characters need to be
updated either as result of such changes in Unicode, as result of a revised
determination of the suitability of a given character for use with markup, or
when additional background information or recommendations will become
available.</p>

<p>Each report carries a revision number, which may be used to refer to a
specific version of the report. Older versions of the report will remain
available. Each version of this report will also specify the underlying
version of the Unicode Standard.</p>
