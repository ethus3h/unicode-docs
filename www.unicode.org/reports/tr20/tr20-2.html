<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This document contains guidelines on the use of the Unicode Standard in
conjunction with markup languages such as XML.
<h4 class="unicode">Status of this document (Unicode Consortium)</h4>
<p class="unicode">This proposed draft is published for review purposes. This
draft has been considered by the Unicode Technical Committee and approved as
proposed draft for internal review by Unicode Members and members of W3C
Internationalization WG. At its next meeting, the Unicode Technical Committee
may approve, reject, or further amend this document. <em class="unicode">It is
intended that this document will become a joint Unicode - W3C document.</em>
<p class="unicode">The content of technical reports must be understood in the
context of the latest version of the Unicode Standard. See <a class="unicode" href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/versions/">http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/versions/</a>
for more information.
<p class="unicode">This document does not, at this time, imply any endorsement
by the Consortium's staff or member organizations. Please mail comments to <a class="unicode" href="mailto:unicore@unicode.org">unicore@unicode.org</a>.
<h4>Status of this document (W3C)</h4>
<p>This is a W3C Working Draft worked on jointly by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/Group/">W3C
Internationalization Working Group/Interest Group</a> (<a href="http://cgi.w3.org/MemberAccess/AccessRequest">Members
only</a>) and the Unicode Technical Committee. For public discussion of this
working draft, please use the mailing lists www-international@w3.org and unicode@unicode.org
(please crosspost to both lists). For internal discussions, please use the
relevant mailing list (again with crossposting). Please send editorial comments
to the authors.
<p>The material in this draft is still in a rather early stage. Currently the
draft shows the approximate range of intended coverage (e.g. in terms of which
kinds of characters will be addressed, and what kind of information that is
intended to be provided for each kind), while large parts still need more work
and discussion. It is not exactly clear yet what the exact proposal for each
character may be, and how this document will be related to other W3C
specifications. One potential way to proceed is to work towards publishing this
document as a Note, and to reference it, normatively or otherwise, from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-charmod">Character
Model</a> [<a href="tr20-2.html#CharMod">CharMod</a>] document.
<p>Publication as a Working Draft does not imply endorsement by the W3C
membership. This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted
by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to cite W3C Drafts as other
than &quot;work in progress&quot;. A list of current W3C working drafts can be

<h2><a name="Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The Unicode Standard contains a large number of characters in order to cover
the scripts of the world. It also contains characters for compatibility with
older character encodings, and characters with control-like functions included
for various reasons. It also provides specifications for use of these
characters.
<p>For document and data interchange, the Internet and the World Wide Web are
more and more making use of marked-up text. In many instances, markup provides
the same, or essentially similar features to those provided by formatting
characters in the Unicode Standard [<a href="tr20-2.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] for use in
plain text. While there may be valid reasons to support these characters and
their specifications in plain text, their use in marked-up text can conflict
with the rules of the markup language.
<p>[a more extensive overview of Unicode and markup will be added to level out
the background of various audiences]
<h3>1.1 Notation</h3>
<p>This report uses XML [<a href="tr20-2.html#XML">XML</a>] as a prominent and general
example of markup. The XML namespace notation [<a href="tr20-2.html#Namespace">Namespace</a>]
is used to indicate that a certain element is taken from a specific markup
language. As an example, the prefix 'html:' indicates that this element is taken
from [<a href="tr20-2.html#XHTML">XHTML</a>]. This means that the examples containing the
namespace prefix 'html:' are assumed to include a namespace declaration of
xmlns:html=&quot;...&quot; [Ed. note: insert the appropriate URI for XHTML
later].
<p>Characters are denoted using the notation used in the Unicode Standard, i.e.
U+ followed by their hexadecimal number such as &quot;U+1234&quot;. In XML or
HTML this would be expressed as &quot;&amp;#x1234;&quot;. [Should this be
replaced by the XML convention? Probably not, because we don't want to see these
in XML :-)]
<h2><a name="General">2. General Considerations</a></h2>
<p>This chapter will contain general considerations regarding control-like
characters in markup. In particular, it is planned to address the following
points:
<ul>
  <li>Linearity of text vs. hierarchy of markup structure
  <li>Coincidence (in most cases) of semantic markup and functions of control
    characters (e.g. &lt;html:q&gt; for insertions of fragments from another
    language,...)
  <li>Extensibility of markup
  <li>Problems with structural alignment between markup and control characters
  <li>Ambiguity or interference of control characters in markup <em>source</em>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Charlist">3. List of Characters</a></h2>
<p>The following table contains the characters currently considered not suitable
for use with markup. Each category is further discussed below.

</table>
<p>A later version of this document will discuss each of the character
categories. For each of the categories/characters, the following points may be
discussed:
<ul>
  <li>Short description of semantics
  <li>Reason for inclusion in Unicode
  <li>Specific problems when used with markup
  <li>Other areas where problems may occur (e.g. plain text)
  <li>What kind of markup to use in place
  <li>What to if detected (remove/ignore/replace/complain,...)
</ul>
<p>The following subsection gives an example:
<h3>3.1 Object Replacement Character, U+FFFC</h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: The object replacement character is used to stand
in place of an object (e.g. an image) included in a text.
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: The object replacement character was included
in Unicode only in order to reserve a codepoint for a very frequent
application-internal use. Many text-processing applications store the text and
the associated markup (or in some cases styling information) of a document in
separate structures. The actual text is kept in a single linear structure;
additional information is kept separately with pointers to the appropriate text
positions. The overall implementation makes sure that these two structures are
kept in sync. If the text contains objects such as images, it is extremely
helpful for implementations to have a sentinel in the text itself; any
additional information is kept separately.
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Including an object replacement
character in markup text does not work because the additional information (what
object to include,...) is not available.
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The object replacement character is also
problematic when used in plain text, because there is no way in plain text to
provide the actual object information or a reference to it.
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: The markup to be used in place of the Object
Replacement Character depends on the object in question and the markup context
it is used in. Typical cases are &lt;html:img src'...' /&gt;, &lt;html:object
...&gt;, or &lt;html:applet ...&gt;. These constructs allow to provide all
additional information needed to identify and use the object in question.
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: In a proxy context context, ignore. In a
browser context, treat as either a missing image, or a REPLACEMENT CHARACTER
When received in an editing context, if the actual object is accessable, replace
the character by the appropriate markup for that object. Otherwise remove,
ideally providing a warning.
<h3>3.2 Interlinear Annotation Characters, U+FFF9-U+FFFB</h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: The interlinear annotation characters are used to
delimit interlinear annotations in certain circumstances.
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: The interlinear annotation characters were
included in Unicode only in order to reserve codepoints for very frequent
application-internal use.The interlinear annotation characters are used to
delimit interlinear annotations in contexts where other delimiters are not
available, and where non-textual means exist to carry formatting information.
Many text-processing applications store the text and the associated markup (or
in some cases styling information) of a document in separate structures. The
actual text is kept in a single linear structure; additional information is kept
separately with pointers to the appropriate text positions. This is called
out-of-band information. The overall implementation makes sure that these two
structures are kept in sync. If the text contains interlinear annotations, it is
extremely helpful for implementations to have delimiters in the text itself;
even though delimiters are not otherwise used for style markup.With this method,
and unlike the case of the object replacement character, all textual information
can remain in the standard text stream, but any additional formatting
information is kept separately. In addition, the Interlinear Annotation Anchor
serves as a place holder for formatting information for the whole annotation
object, the same way a paragraph mark can be a placeholder to attach paragraph
formatting information.
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Including interlinear annotation
characters in markup text does not work because the additional formatting
information (how to position the annotation,...) is not available.
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The interlinear annotation characters are
also problematic when used in plain text, and are not intended for that purpose.
In particular, on older display systems that ignore or replace the Interlinear
Annotation Characters, the meaning of the text may be changed.
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: The markup to be used in place of the
Interlinear Annotation Characters depends on the formatting an nature of the
interlinear annotation in question. For ruby, please see [<a href="tr20-2.html#Ruby">Ruby</a>].
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: In a proxy context or browser context,
remove U+FFF9 and remove all characters between U+FFFA and following U+FFFB.
When received in an editing context, either remove in the same manner, maybe
with a warning to the user, or convert into appropriate ruby markup for further
editing and formatting by the user.
<h2><a name="Compatibility">4. Characters with compatibility mappings</a></h2>
<p>The Unicode Standard provides compatibility mappings for a number of
characters. Compatibility mappings indicate a relationship to another character,
but the exact nature of the relationship varies. In some cases the relationship
means &quot;is based on&quot; in some other cases it denotes a property. When
plain text is marked up, it may make sense to map some of these characters to
their compatibility equivalents <em>and</em> suitable markup. It is important to
understand the nature of the distinctions between characters and their
compatibility equivalents and the context in where these distintions matter. It
is never advisable to apply compatibility mappings indiscriminantly. This
section provides guidance on when and how to apply compatibility mappings. It is
organized by the &quot;compatibility tag&quot; associated with each
compatibility mapping.
<h3>4.1 Overview</h3>
<p>The following table gives an overview of the various compatibility
characters, organized by &quot;compatibility tag&quot;. The first column
contains the tag value of the &quot;compatibility tag&quot; from the Unicode
database. Although these tags use &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;, they
should not be confused with XML tags. <em>Code range</em> indicates which
codepoints the entry applies to. <em>Substitute </em>indicates whether the codes
can be substituted using the compatibility equivalent according to Normalization
Form KC of [<a href="tr20-2.html#UTR15">UTR 15</a>]. <em>Markup</em> indicates the
available markup. For some cases, instead of or in addition to markup, style
information [<a href="tr20-2.html#CSS2">CSS2</a>] is needed. [Discussion about style info
to be added in the future.]

<p>Notes
<p>At the time of this writing it was not known what the appropriate markup
would be for squared kana clusters or horizontal in vertical symbols.
<h3>4.2 Generating characters</h3>
<p>Presentation forms and characters for which adequate representation exists as
marked up text should never be generated for new data. Many of the characters
with &lt;font&gt; tag are suitable for new data, as long as they are used in the
manner they are intended, that is as symbols, with definite semantic
differentiation between the different forms. They should not be used to create
styled text, but styled text should not be used to carry the essential semantic
distinction needed for example for mathematics.
<h3>4.3 Bullets</h3>
<p>[Ed. Note: this is an example of a detail section for particular
compatibility characters.]
<p><em>Short description</em>: Characters with a &lt;circled&gt; tag or
characters with &lt;compat&gt; tag and compatibility mapping to a parenthesized
string.
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: They are most frequently used for enumerated
bullets, but the characters with a &lt;circled&gt; tag often occur as dingbats
or footnote markers in tables.
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters do not cause undue
interaction with markup
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: None
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: (bullet style) When generating marked up text
these characters occur only internal to the user agent as bullet styles are
rendered. When marking up plain text data they could be converted to suitable
bullet styles, if such use can be properly inferred.
<p>Compatibility mappings of the form (<em>n</em>) or (<em>n</em>.) can be kept
as single characters, or replaced by bullet styles. A conversion to bullet
styles allows a simple extension of the set to arbitrary numbers. This is in
contrast to circled characters: Very few browsers can properly generate
arbitrary circled numbers, therefore conversion to bullet styles does not easily
allow an extension of the set of accessible circled numbers.
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: In a proxy context or browser context no
action needs to be taken.When received in an editing context, substitution of a
bullet style may be appropriate. However, the same characters are very often
used as dingbat-like symbols in tables, so the user should have the choice of
whether to replace.

<h2><a name="Versioning">5. Versioning</a></h2>
<p>This technical report covers all relevant characters in the Unicode Standard,
Version 3.0.
<p>As the Unicode standard is updated and new characters get added, new
characters that are not suitable for markup may also be added. However, the
Unicode Technical Committee only introduces such characters where there is a
very strong industry requirement. As markup becomes more prevalent, the need for
such characters is reduced substantially. This report itself may be updated
periodically to give additional background information.
