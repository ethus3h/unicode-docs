<h2><a name="Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The Unicode Standard&nbsp; [<a href="tr20-3.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] is<font color="#008080">
 </font> 
the universal character set. Its primary goal is to provide an unambiguous
encoding of the content of plain text, ultimately covering all languages in the
world. Currently in its third major version, Unicode contains a large number of characters
covering most of the currently used scripts in the world. It also contains
additional characters for interoperability with
older character encodings, and characters with control-like functions included primarily
for reasons of
providing unambiguous interpretation of plain text. Unicode provides specifications for use of
all of these
characters.<p>For document and data interchange, the Internet and the World Wide Web are
more and more making use of marked-up text. In many instances, markup provides
the same, or essentially similar features to those provided by formatting
characters in the Unicode Standard for use in
plain text. While there may be valid reasons to support these characters and
their specifications in plain text, their use in marked-up text can conflict
with the rules of the markup language.<p>The issues of
using Unicode characters with marked-up text depend to some degree on the rules
of the markup language in question and the set of elements it contains. In a
narrow sense, this document concerns itself only with XML and to some extent
HTML, however, much of the general information presented here should be
useful in a broader context, including some page layout languages.
<h3>1.1 Notation</h3>
<p>This report uses XML [<a href="tr20-3.html#XML">XML</a>] as a prominent and general
example of markup. The XML namespace notation [<a href="tr20-3.html#Namespace">Namespace</a>]
is used to indicate that a certain element is taken from a specific markup
language. As an example, the prefix 'html:' indicates that this element is taken
from [<a href="tr20-3.html#XHTML">XHTML</a>]. This means that the examples containing the
namespace prefix 'html:' are assumed to include a namespace declaration of
xmlns:html=&quot;...&quot;&nbsp;
<p>Characters are denoted using the notation used in the Unicode Standard, i.e.
U+ followed by their hexadecimal number such as &quot;U+1234&quot;. In XML or
HTML this would be expressed as &quot;&amp;#x1234;&quot;.&nbsp;
<h2><a name="General">2. General Considerations</a></h2>
<p>There are several general points to consider when looking at the interaction
between character encoding and markup.&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>Linearity of text vs. hierarchy of markup structure
  <li>Overlap of control codes and markup semantics
  <li>Coincidence of semantic markup and functions&nbsp;
  <li>Extensibility of markup
  <li>Markup <i> vs.</i> Styling
</ul>
<h3 align="left">2.1 Linearity versus Structure</h3>
<p align="left">Encoding text as a
sequence of characters without further information leads to a linear sequence,
commonly called plain text. Character follows character, without any particular
structure. Markup, on the other hand, defines a hierarchical structure for the
text or data. In the case of XML and most other, similar markup languages, the
markup defines a tree structure. While this tree structure is linearized for
transmission in the XML document, once the document has been parsed, the tree is
available directly.<p align="left">Operations that are easy to perform on trees,
are often difficult to perform on linear sequences and vice versa. By separating
functionality between character encoding and markup appropriately, the
architecture becomes simpler, more powerful and longer-lasting.<p align="left">In
particular, operations on hierarchical structures can easily make sure that
information is kept in context. Attributes assigned to parts of a document are
moved together with the associated part of the document. Assigning an attribute
to a part of a document limits the scope of the attribute to that part of the
document. Performing the same operations on linear sequences of characters using
control codes to set attributes and to delimit their scope requires much more
work and is error prone. Locating the start or end of a span of text of the same
attribute requires scanning backwards and forwards for the embedded delimiter or
control code. Moving or editing text often results in mismatched control codes,
so that an attribute might suddenly apply to text it was not intended for.<h3 align="left">2.2
Overlap of Control Code and Markup Semantics</h3>
<p align="left">When markup is not
available, plain text may require control characters. This is usually the case
where plain text must contain some scoping or attribute information in order to
be legible, <i>i.e.</i> to be able to transmit the same content between
originator and receiver. Many of these control characters have direct
equivalents in particular markup languages, since markup handles these concerns efficiently. If both
characters and their markup equivalents may be present in the same text, the question of priority is raised: Which of
the settings has priority and in which case? Therefore it is important to
identify and resolve these ambiguities at the time markup is first applied.<h3 align="left">2.3
Markup and Styling</h3>
<p align="left">Besides the basic character encoding and text
markup there is a third contributor to text functionality, namely styling.
Markup is concerned with the logical structure of the text or data, <i>e.g. </i>to
indicate sections, subsections, and headers in a document, or to indicate the
various fields of an address record. Styling is used to present the information
in various ways, <i>e.g.</i> in different fonts, different type styles (italic,
bold), different colors, <i>etc.. </i>Some character codes do not encode a
generic character, but a styled character. Where these characters are used,
styling information is frozen, <i>i.e.</i> it is no longer possible to alter the
appearance of the text by applying style information. However, there are many
examples where a historically free stylistic variation has over time become a
semantic distinction that is properly encoded as plain text. In such instances,
altering the appearance of the text by styling information would irreparably
alter the content of the text.<h3 align="left">2.4 Coincidence of Markup
and Functions</h3>
<p align="left">Dealing with various functionalities on the markup
level has the additional advantage that in most cases, text portions that need
some particular attribute (or styling) are actually those text portions
identified by markup. A paragraph may be in French, a citation may need a bidi
embedding, a keyword may be in italics, a list number may be circled, <i>etc.</i>.
This makes it very efficient to associate those attributes with markup.<h3 align="left">2.5
Extensibility of Markup</h3>
<p align="left">Character encoding works with a range of
integers used as character codes. This is extremely efficient, but has some
limitations. Markup on the other hand, is much more extensible. Using
technologies such as [<a href="tr20-3.html#Namespace">Namespace</a>] various vocabularies can be mixed. This is
important for functionality that depends on complex context.<h3 align="left">2.6
Local Context</h3>
<p align="left">Where local, or point like context is required,
markup is not very efficient and its main benefit, easy manipulation of scope, is
not required. On the contrary, the intrusion of markup in the middle of words
can make search or sort operations more difficult. For these cases expressing
the information as character codes is not only a viable, but often the preferred
alternative, which needs to be
considered in the design of markup languages.
<h2><a name="Charlist">3. List of Characters</a></h2>
<h3>3. 1 List of discouraged characters</h3>
<p>There are characters whose use in the context of markup in XML/HTML should be
considered discouraged, because these characters are
<ul>
  <li>deprecated in the Unicode Standard</li>
  <li>unsupportable without additional information</li>
  <li>or undesirable because of conflict with equivalent markup</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table contains the characters currently considered <b> not suitable</b> for use with markup in
XML/HTML, and may also be unsuitable for other markup or page layout languages.&nbsp;

<p>Sections 3.3 through 3.7 discuss in more details the follwing points the&nbsp;
characters in table 3.1:
<ul>
  <li>Short description of semantics

<p>Except for Line and Paragraph Separator characters in table 3.2 it is <i>always</i> acceptable for user
agents to ignore the presence of discouraged characters in HTML or XML. It is up to authoring tools to
ensure proper conversion between these characters and equivalent markup where it
exists.</p>

<h3>3.3 Line and Paragraph Separator,
U+2028..U+2029</h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: The line and paragraph separator provide
unambiguous means to denote hard line breaks and paragraph delimiters in plain
text.<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters were introduced into the
Unicode Standard to overcome the ambiguous and widely divergent use of control
codes for this purpose. See Unicode Technical Report #13, Unicode Newline
Guidelines <a href="tr20-3.html#UTR9">[UTR13]</a>.<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Including
these characters in markup text does not work because it would duplicate the
existing markup commands for delimiting paragraphs and lines.
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The separator characters can also
problematic when used in plain text, because legacy data is usually converted
code point for code point into Unicode and all receivers of Unicode plain text
have to effectively be able to interpret the existing use of control codes for
this purpose.<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: Use &lt;html:br /&gt; instead of
U+2028 and surround paragraphs by &lt;html:p&gt; and &lt;/html:p&gt; instead of
separating them with U+2029.
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: In a
browser context, treat as whitespace.
When received in an editing context, replace
the character by the corresponding markup.&nbsp;
<h3>3.4 BIDI embedding controls (LRE, RLE, LRO, RLO, PDF), U+202A .. U+202E</h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: The BIDI embedding controls are required to
supplement the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm in plain text<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: The
Unicode Bidirectional algorithm unambiguously resolves the display direction for
bidirectional text. It does so, by assigning all characters directional
categories and then resolving these in context. In a small number of
circumstances this <i>implicit&nbsp;</i> method does not produce satisfactory
results and embedding controls are needed to ensure that sender and receiver
agree on the display direction for a given text. See Unicode Technical Report #
9, The Bidirectional Algorithm <a href="tr20-3.html#UTR9">[UTR 9]</a>.
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters duplicate available
markup, which is better suited to handle the stateful nature of their
effect.&nbsp;
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The embedding controls introduce a state
into the plain text which must be maintained editing or displaying the text.
Processes that are modifying the text without being aware of this state may inadvertently
affect the rendering of large portions of the text, for example by removing a
PDF.<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: The following table gives the replacement
markup:<br>

<p>For details on bidi markup, please see Section 8.2 of
HTML [<a href="tr20-3.html#HTML4.0-8.2">HMTL 4.0-8.2</a>]. The text of HTML 4.0 gives this
recommendation:&nbsp;
<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Using HTML directionality markup with Unicode
characters.</strong> Authors and designers of authoring software should be
aware that conflicts can arise if the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr20/dirlang.html#adef-dir" class= 
"noxref"><samp class="ainst">dir</samp></a> attribute is used on inline
elements (including <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr20/dirlang.html#edef-BDO" class="noxref"><samp class= 
"einst">BDO</samp></a>) concurrently with the corresponding <a rel=
"biblioentry" href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/references.html#ref-UNICODE" class="normref">
[UNICODE]</a> formatting characters. Preferably one or the other should be used
exclusively. The markup method offers a better guarantee of document structural
integrity and alleviates some problems when editing bidirectional HTML text
with a simple text editor, but some software may be more apt at using the <a
rel="biblioentry" href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/references.html#ref-UNICODE" class="normref">
[UNICODE]</a> characters. If both methods are used, great care should be
exercised to insure proper nesting of markup and directional embedding or
override, otherwise, rendering results are undefined.</em>

<p>This document goes beyond HTML and recommends that <i>only</i> the markup
should be used.
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: In a
browser context, ignore. When received in an editing context,
replace
the characters by the appropriate markup.&nbsp;
<h3>3.5<em> </em>Deprecated Formatting Characters, U+206A..U+206F</h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: These characters are deprecated. They were
originally intended to allow explicit activation of contextual shaping, numeric
digit rendering and symmetric swapping.<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These
characters were retained from draft versions of ISO 10646.
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: The processing model for these
characters is not supported in markup.<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The
Unicode Standard requires that symmetric swapping, contextual shaping and
alternate digit shapes are enabled by default and no longer supports inhibiting
any of them by use of these character codes. The most likely effect of their
occurrence in generated text would be that of a 'garbage' character.
<p><em>Conversion for use with markup</em>: Apply the
appropriate conversion to bring the data stream in line with the Unicode text
model for bidirectional text and cursively connected scripts.<p><em>What to do if detected</em>:
When received by a browser as part of marked up text, they may be ignored.
When received in an editing context, they may removed, possibly with a warning.<font color="#008080">
 </font>
Alternatively, an appropriate conversion from the legacy text model may be
provided. This
will most likely be limited to applications directly interfacing with and
knowledgeable of the particular legacy implementation that inspired these
characters.
<h3>3.6 Interlinear Annotation Characters, U+FFF9-U+FFFB</h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: The interlinear annotation characters are used to
delimit interlinear annotations in certain circumstances. They
are intended to provide text anchors and delimiters for interlinear annotation
for in-process use and are not intended for interchange.
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: The interlinear annotation characters were
included in Unicode only in order to reserve code points for very frequent
application-internal use. The interlinear annotation characters are used to
delimit interlinear annotations in contexts where other delimiters are not
available, and where non-textual means exist to carry formatting information.
Many text-processing applications store the text and the associated markup (or
in some cases styling information) of a document in separate structures. The
actual text is kept in a single linear structure; additional information is kept
separately with pointers to the appropriate text positions. This is called
out-of-band information. The overall implementation makes sure that these two
structures are kept in sync. If the text contains interlinear annotations, it is
extremely helpful for implementations to have delimiters in the text itself;
even though delimiters are not otherwise used for style markup. With this method,
and unlike the case of the object replacement character, all textual information
can remain in the standard text stream, but any additional formatting
information is kept separately. In addition, the Interlinear Annotation Anchor
serves as a place holder for formatting information for the whole annotation
object, the same way a paragraph mark can be a placeholder to attach paragraph
formatting information.
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Including interlinear annotation
characters in markup text does not work because the additional formatting
information (how to position the annotation,...) is not available.
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The interlinear annotation characters are
also problematic when used in plain text, and are not intended for that purpose.
In particular, on older display systems that simply ignore or replace the Interlinear
Annotation Characters, the meaning of the text may be changed.
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: The markup to be used in place of the
Interlinear Annotation Characters depends on the formatting and nature of the
interlinear annotation in question. For ruby, please see [<a href="tr20-3.html#Ruby">Ruby</a>].<p><em>What to do if detected</em>:&nbsp;
When received by a browser as part of marked up text, they may be ignored. When
receiving plain text in an editing environment, editor may take one or more of
several actions: remove U+FFF9 together with removing all characters between U+FFFA and following
U+FFFB,&nbsp; ignore U+FFF9 and turn  U+FFFA and  U+FFFB&nbsp; to "[" and "]"
respectively, issue a warning to the user, or tentatively convert into appropriate ruby markup for further
editing and formatting by the user.
<h3>3.7 Object Replacement Character, U+FFFC</h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: The object replacement character is used to stand
in place of an object (e.g. an image) included in a text.
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: The object replacement character was included
in Unicode only in order to reserve a codepoint for a very frequent
application-internal use. Many text-processing applications store the text and
the associated markup (or in some cases styling information) of a document in
separate structures. The actual text is kept in a single linear structure;
additional information is kept separately with pointers to the appropriate text
positions. The overall implementation makes sure that these two structures are
kept in sync. If the text contains objects such as images, it is extremely
helpful for implementations to have a sentinel in the text itself; any
additional information is kept separately.
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Including an object replacement
character in markup text does not work because the additional information (what
object to include,...) is not available.
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The object replacement character is also
problematic when used in plain text, because there is no way in plain text to
provide the actual object information or a reference to it.
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: The markup to be used in place of the Object
Replacement Character depends on the object in question and the markup context
it is used in. Typical cases are &lt;html:img src'...' /&gt;, &lt;html:object
...&gt;, or &lt;html:applet ...&gt;. These constructs allow to provide all
additional information needed to identify and use the object in question.
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: Browsers may ignore this character.
When received in an editing context, if the actual object is
accessible, editors may either replace
the character by the appropriate markup for that object, or otherwise remove it,
ideally providing a warning.
<h3>3.8 Language Tag Characters</h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: A series of characters from U-000E0000 .. U-000E007F
that can be used to express language tags, based on existing
standards for language tags using the rules in [<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr20/UTR7">UTR7</a>].<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These
characters allow in-band language tagging in situations where full markup is not
available, while allowing easy filtering by applications that do not support
them. They were specifically included for the benefit of Internet protocols such
as ACAP, which require a standard mechanism for marking language in UTF-8
strings and to avoid the
use of other schemes that relied on specific details of the encoding form used.
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters duplicate information
that can be expressed in markup.
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: Their special code range allows them to be
easily filtered, but applications that don't expect them will treat them as
garbage characters.
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: Replace with equivalent language markup &lt;html:lang&gt;
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: Browsers may ignore these characters.
When received in an editing context, editors may remove and/or replace them by equivalent markup.
<h2><a name="Compatibility">4. Characters with compatibility mappings</a></h2>
<p>The Unicode Standard provides compatibility mappings for a number of
characters. Compatibility mappings indicate a relationship to another character,
but the exact nature of the relationship varies. In some cases the relationship
means &quot;is based on&quot; in some other cases it denotes a property. When
plain text is marked up, it may make sense to map some of these characters to
their compatibility equivalents <em>and</em> suitable markup. It is important to
understand the nature of the distinctions between characters and their
compatibility equivalents and the context in where these distinctions matter. It
is never advisable to apply compatibility mappings indiscriminately. This
section provides guidance on when and how to apply compatibility mappings. It is
organized by the &quot;compatibility tag&quot; associated with each
compatibility mapping.
<h3>4.1 Overview</h3>
<p>The following table gives an overview of the various compatibility
characters, organized by &quot;compatibility tag&quot;. The first column
contains the tag value of the &quot;compatibility tag&quot; from the Unicode
database. Although these tags use &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;, they
should not be confused with XML tags. <em>Code range</em> indicates which code points
the entry applies to. <em>Substitute </em>indicates whether the codes
can be substituted using the compatibility equivalent according to Normalization
Form KC of [<a href="tr20-3.html#UTR15">UTR 15</a>]. <em>Markup</em> indicates the
available markup. For some cases, instead of or in addition to markup, style
information [<a href="tr20-3.html#CSS2">CSS2</a>] is needed.&nbsp;

<h3>4.2 Generating characters</h3>
<p>Presentation forms and characters for which adequate representation exists as
marked up text should never be generated for new data. However, many of the characters
with &lt;font&gt; tag are suitable for new data, as long as they are used in the
manner they are intended, that is as symbols, with definite semantic
differentiation between the different forms. They must not be used to create
styled text. On the other hand, styled text should not be used to carry the essential semantic
distinction needed for example for mathematics.
<h3>4.3 Bullets</h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: Characters with a &lt;circled&gt; tag or
characters with &lt;compat&gt; tag and compatibility mapping to a parenthesized
string.
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: They are most frequently used for enumerated
bullets, but the characters with a &lt;circled&gt; tag often occur as dingbats
or footnote markers in tables.
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters do not cause undue
interaction with markup
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: None
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: (bullet style) When generating marked up text
these characters occur only internal to the user agent when bullet styles are
rendered. When marking up plain text data they could be converted to suitable
bullet styles, if such use can be properly inferred. However, it is often
necessary to refer to numbered or lettered bullets in the text.
<p>Compatibility mappings of the form (<em>n</em>) or (<em>n</em>.) can be kept
as single characters, or replaced by bullet styles. A conversion to bullet
styles allows a simple extension of the set to arbitrary numbers. This is in
contrast to circled characters: Very few browsers can properly generate
arbitrary circled numbers, therefore conversion to bullet styles does not easily
allow an extension of the set of accessible circled numbers.
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No
action needs to be taken by browsers. When received in an editing context, substitution of a
bullet style may be appropriate. However, the same characters are very often
used as dingbat-like symbols in tables, so the user should have the choice of
whether to replace.
<h3>4.4 Fractions</h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: Single character fractions such as ½ or ¼.
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: A subset of these occur in practically all
legacy character sets.
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: The repertoire is limited to a few
common fractions. When used with more general methods of generating fractions
such as MathML[<a href="tr20-3.html#MathML">MathML</a>] the usual problem of dual
representation arises.<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: Other than
normalization issues, these characters present no undue problems in plain text.<font color="#008080">
 </font>
Where fraction slash is supported, these can be expressed by substituting their
compatibility mappings.<p><em>Replacement markup</em>:
MathML.
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action needs to be taken by browsers or
editors.
<h3>4.5 Squared or horizontal</h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: Characters that are symbols composed of groups of
typically kana or Latin letters, digits plus slash for use in a single display
cell in vertical display of text.&nbsp;
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: Many existing character sets contain these as
precomposed characters since for simple implementations this is the only way to
support the common use of providing metric units and other abbreviations in a
single character cell for vertical text layout.&nbsp;
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Proposed markup, including CSS styling,
would be able express an unbounded set of these abbreviations, obviating the need of
cataloguing these in the character encoding standard and making them more
directly accessible to text based processing, for example searching.
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The repertoire of these legacy characters
is limited; many more combinations are in actual use than are accounted for in
character sets. Pre-composed symbols do not make their text content available to
search engines. They also require re-encoding for text laid out horizontally.
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: not available at this time.
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action required.
<h3>4.6 Superscripts and subscripts</h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>:
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: Super and subscript characters occur in many
legacy character sets, including Latin-1. Their use in pure plain text is common
for databases, e.g. including metric units for part descriptions&nbsp; (viz. cm<sup>2</sup>)
or (usually simplified) formulae as occur in titles of scientific publications.<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>:
Using these characters directly in markup provides an alternate representation
compared to marked up text, leading to different treatment by search engines.
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: none
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>:&lt;xhtml:sup&gt; and &lt;xhtml:sub&gt;
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action required by browsers.
When received in an editing context, substitute the corresponding markup.
<h2><a name="Versioning">5. Versioning</a></h2>
<p>This technical report covers all relevant characters in the Unicode Standard,
