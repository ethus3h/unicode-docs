	<h2><a name="Introduction">1 Introduction</a></h2>
	
<p>One problem that has often been considered is how to extract good "categories" for Unicode
characters out of the Unicode names list. This goal is occasioned, for example,
by the need to develop new character picker applications,
which organize characters into groups that will
make sense for people searching for characters in graphic panes
or other UI elements.</p>

<p>The problem is two-fold. First, the existing machine-readable
data files in the Unicode Character Database [<a href="tr49-1.html#UCD">UCD</a>] 
do not provide a fine enough categorization to
meet the requirements of such applications. For example, the General_Category
property distinguishes letters from combining marks
and punctuation and symbols, but it doesn't drill down
to the next level: independent vowel letters versus
consonants versus matras; or game symbols versus map
symbols versus zodiacal symbols versus dingbats, and
so on. Second, people who need that kind of finer
detail of categorization have generally been attempting to extract
it by making use of the editorial subheaders used in
the printing of the Unicode names list, figuring that
that information is better than nothing and assuming that doing
the finer-level classification from scratch would be
prohibitively complex.</p>

<p>However, the subheaders in the Unicode
names list have always been editorial content aimed primarily at
structuring the code charts for display, and are not
particularly well-suited to a systematic categorization
of Unicode characters in any context more extensive than
considering characters visually displayed one chart at a time. Efforts to revise the
subheaders to make them work better for machine-extracted
categorization of Unicode characters from the Unicode
names list are counterproductive. The subheaders would not
work very well if reorganized that way, and the net result would be a
significant deterioration of the editorial content of
the code charts.</p>

<p>The existing
subheaders also often group characters which other applications
might want to distinguish. For example, the
header for the range U+2600..U+260D is "Weather and astrological 
symbols". But we can do much
better, distinguishing more precisely those which are
weather symbols, such as U+2602 UMBRELLA, those which
are astrological symbols, such as U+260A ASCENDING NODE,
and those which really are not either, such as U+2606 WHITE STAR.</p>

<p>What is needed to address the general problem is an approach that focuses
on the character category distinctions needed by such applications,
without being entangled with the editorial requirements for
the Unicode names list maintenance. This document presents such
an approach, and documents the resulting data file that implementers
can use for defining Unicode character categories.</p>


	<h2><a name="Character_Categories">2 Character Categories</a></h2>
	
<p>This section describes the approach taken in this report for the
provision of a set of usable categories for Unicode characters.</p>
	
	<h3>2.1 <a name="Hierarchical_Typology">Hierarchical Typology</a></h3>

<p>The current scheme of categorization uses a hierarchical typology.
Such a scheme assumes that each category provided may itself be further
subdivided at another level into more subcategories. Each subcategorization
is, in principle, independent of the subcategorization of other categories.
Thus, for example, how one might want to subcategorize letters would
typically be quite distinct from how one might most usefully subcategorize
punctuation marks. This approach departs from the structure of
partition properties for Unicode characters, such as the General_Category
property itself. A partition property assumes a single dimension of
semantic applicability, and then assigns every character a single value
within that dimension. Such a character property is easy to implement,
but as users of the General_Category property well know, the drawback
of such partitions for categorization is their rigidity and the inability
to deal with edge cases and nuances.</p>

<p>The approach to categorization taken here makes no assumption that 
any particular level of subcategorization
has any fixed significance. A third-level subcategorization of a punctuation
mark might involve rather different salient distinctions than a third-level
subcategorization of symbols, for example. The typology basically
starts with first-level categories roughly based on the General_Category
property, but then may diverge arbitrarily on a category-by-category basis,
depending on what is most useful for distinguishing characters.</p>

<p>There is no assumption that all levels have to be specified for all
characters. Categories defined this way can  
be extensible based on what level of detail
people find useful to maintain for various characters. There is also
no assumption that there is actually a single correct solution for
categorization. The categorization may be modified and improved over time.
Furthermore, it should be expected that actual implementations will merely
start with categories in the data file and run with them, to provide
whatever additional changes or refinements are needed in their particular
domain.</p>

<p>These general principles are illustrated in part by the following examples,
for several different major categories. For example, for letters:</p>

<pre>
Letter

Letter > Vowel

Letter > Vowel > Dependent  (i.e. Indic matras)

Letter > Consonant > Dependent > Subjoined
</pre>

<p>For symbols:</p>

<pre>
Symbol

Symbol > Graphic

Symbol > Technical

Symbol > Technical > Keyboard

Symbol > Arrow

Symbol > Arrow > Harpoon

Symbol > Arrow > Harpoon > Double
</pre>

<p>For punctuation marks:</p>

<pre>
Punctuation

Punctuation > Space

Punctuation > Quotation

Punctuation > Bracket

Punctuation > Bracket > CJK
</pre>

<p>Currently the categorization makes use of four levels of typology, but
this approach could easily be extended to five (or more), if finer
levels of distinction for some groups of characters proves
to be desirable. For example, arrows could be further subcategorized
based on their shapes and orientations.</p>

	<h3>2.2 <a name="Annotation_Merging">Implementation by Annotation and Merging</a></h3>
	
<p>The approach taken to maintaining this hierarchical typology reuses
technology which is currently designed for maintenance of the Unicode
names list. In particular, category assignments are treated as annotations
over ranges of characters. The annotation file can then be maintained
completely independently of the detailed, character-by-character listing
files that are part of the UCD&#x2014;most importantly, UnicodeData.txt. In this
way, the annotation information (and the associated development and
refinement of categorial assignments) can be version-agnostic, and
is not required to be updated in lockstep with each version of the
Unicode Standard.</p>
	
<p>The program that is used to maintain 
annotations for the Unicode names list has been modified slightly, and 
is now used for an automated merger of 
categorial annotations file with particular versions of the UnicodeData.txt file, 
producing as output a
structured data file containing categorial information
about all Unicode characters, with an explicit listing for each
separate character, including its code point and Unicode character name.</p>

<p>Currently, this merge omits CJK unified ideographs and Hangul syllables.
Categorial information about CJK unified ideographs is better handled
by other means, and in particular the Unihan database. The 11,172 Hangul
syllables do not have useful categorial distinctions in the sense relevant
to other Unicode characters, so including all of them explicitly as part
of a category listing would simply be redundant and verbose.</p>

<p>The merged data is in a suitable format
for direct import into a spreadsheet. Once in a spreadsheet,
the data can easily be further manipulated to whatever end
an implementer needs. See <i>Section 3, <a href="tr49-1.html#Data_File">Data File</a></i>, for a specification of
the format in detail.</p>

	<h3>2.3 <a name="Category_Names">Names for Categories</a></h3>
	
<p class="reviewnote">The principles for how to label various categories in the data file
are not yet worked out, and will be subject to discussion by the UTC members. The data file
currently just has proposed categories that may be useful. Some suggestions for potentially
useful principles for category naming or labelling have been made, and are simply
listed briefly here, to start the discussion.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Each label should have a name that is meaningful in isolation. E.g.
   "Western Music", not "Western".</li>
   	<li>Labels should be the same (or nearly) only when they really mean the
   same thing.</li>
   	<li>Labels that mean the same thing (or nearly) should be the same.</li>
   	<li>Labels should not be "empty"; that is, if a category further down the
   	hierarchy is given a label, an intermediate level should not be missing a
   	label. (This will simplify algorithmic processing of the categories
   	in the data file.)</li>
</ul>

	<h3>2.4 <a name="Informative_Status">Informative Status of the Categories</a></h3>

<p>The first key here is staying flexible, so that the classification can
be extended and modified easily in the future, as may
prove suitable. Using an annotation approach and then programmatic merging with
UnicodeData.txt makes it very easy to assign new
subtypes or to change or subdivide ranges already assigned to
types and subtypes, without having to do extensive modification
of files that give explicit listings of values for each character.</p>

<p>The second key is corollary to the first: this <i>must</i> not turn
into another normative data file and/or normative set of
property values. That is the trap that has always afflicted
the General_Category property and which makes it useless for
this kind of finer-level categorization of Unicode characters.</p>
	
	<h2><a name="Data_File">3 Data File</a></h2>

<p>The categories data is available in a data file [<a href="tr49-1.html#Data">Data</a>] called
Categories.txt. That data file contains a listing of all Unicode characters
other than CJK unified ideographs and Hangul syllables, giving informative category values
at up to four levels of hierarchical assignment.</p>

<p>The data is formatted in tab-delimited fields, suitable for spreadsheet import. The
field values, along with a sample of the particular category values are shown below.</p>

<pre>
Code GC Level1    Level2       Level3      Level4  Name

23CE So Symbol    Technical    Keyboard            RETURN SYMBOL
...
2460 No Symbol    Number       Circled             CIRCLED DIGIT ONE
...
25CB So Symbol    Geometric                        WHITE CIRCLE
...
2602 So Symbol    Weather                          UMBRELLA
...
260A So Symbol    Astrological                     ASCENDING NODE
...
2660 So Symbol    Game         Playing card Suit   BLACK SPADE SUIT
...
2FBD So Ideograph Radical      CJK          Kangxi KANGXI RADICAL HAIR
...
A869 Lo Letter    Consonant                        PHAGS-PA LETTER TTA
...
</pre>

<p class="reviewnote">Note that for debugging and early review, the current data file
brackets each label, so that the values, including spaces, are easier to see
and compare. The brackets are not part of the actual category values.
So for example, an entry will currently appear as follows:</p>

<pre class="reviewnote">
2660 So [Symbol]    [Game]         [Playing card] [Suit]   BLACK SPADE SUIT
</pre>

<p class="reviewnote">Also for debugging and review purposes, empty values in
unspecified fields are listed as "[X]", rather than as a blank. These conventions
are only temporary, to assist review when viewing this data in browsers or
editors, and are not intended to be used in the actual data file in the future.</p>
