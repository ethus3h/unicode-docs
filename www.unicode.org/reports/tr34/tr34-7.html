	<p>The Unicode Standard specifies notational conventions for referring to 
	sequences of characters (or code points), using angle brackets surrounding a 
	comma-delimited list of code points, code points plus character names, and 
	so on. For example, both of the designations in <i>Table 1</i> refer to a combining character sequence consisting of the letter “a” 
    with a circumflex and an acute accent applied to it.</p>
	<div class="center"><center>
		<p class="caption">Table 1. <span style="font-weight: 400">Example of a Combining Character Sequence</span></p>

    <p>See <i>Appendix A,</i> <i>Notational Conventions,</i> in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-3.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] for the 
    description of the conventions for expression of code points and for the 
    representation of sequences of code points.</p>
    <p>The Unicode conventions for referring to a sequence of characters (or 
    code points) are a generalization of the formal syntax specified in ISO/IEC 
    10646:2003 for UCS Sequence Identifiers, or USI. A USI has the form</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&lt;UID<sub>1</sub>, UID<sub>2</sub>, ... UID<sub>n</sub>&gt;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p></p>
    <p>where the UID<sub><i>i</i></sub> represent the short identifiers for code points—most commonly “U+0061” or “0061”. A USI must contain at least two code points.</p>

    <p>Such a conventional notation for sequences of Unicode code points 
	that are 
    treated as a unit is often useful. For example, other standards may need to refer to 
	entities that are represented in Unicode by sequences of characters. 
	Mapping tables may map single characters in other standards to sequences of 
	Unicode characters, and listings of repertoire coverage for fonts or 
    keyboards may need to reference entities that do not correspond to single 
    Unicode code points.</p>
    <p>In some limited circumstances it is necessary to also provide a name for 
	such sequences. The primary example is the need to have an identifier for a 
	sequence to correlate with an identifier in another standard, for which a 
	cross-mapping to Unicode is desired. To address this need, the Unicode 
	Standard defines a mechanism for naming sequences and provides a short list 
	of sequences that have been formally named. This list is deliberately 
	selective: it is neither possible nor desirable to attempt to provide names 
	for all possible sequences of Unicode characters that could be of&nbsp; 
	interest. </p>
    <p>This annex defines the concept of a <i>Unicode named character sequence</i>, 
    specifies a notational convention for such sequences, and a set of rules constraining 
    possible names applied to character sequences. <span class="section">Section </span><span class="secno">5,</span><i>
	<a href="tr34-7.html#DataFile">Data Files</a></i>, identifies the data file containing the normative list 
    of Unicode named character sequences. As is the case for character 
	names, named character sequences are strictly synchronized with ISO/IEC 
	10646.</p>
    <p><i>Table 2</i> provides some examples of Unicode named character sequences to 
    illustrate the kinds of entities that have been formally named. The 
    “Sequence” column illustrates the entity in question with a representative 
    rendering above the sequence of encoded Unicode 
    characters that represent that entity. The “Name” column shows the name 
    that has been associated with that sequence.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
	<h3 class="section"><a name="VarSequ">1.1 Relation to Variation Sequences</a></h3>
	<p>Unicode named character sequences differ from Unicode variation 
    sequences. The latter are documented in <i>Section 16.4</i>, <i>Variation Selectors,</i> in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-3.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] and are listed exhaustively in the data file StandardizedVariants.txt 
    in the Unicode Character Database [<a href="../tr41/tr41-3.html#UCD">UCD</a>].</p>
    <p>Variation sequences always consist of a sequence of precisely 
	defined code points, 
	the second of which must be a variation selector. There are additional constraints on which types 
    of characters they can start with. Variation sequences have a restricted 
	range of 
    glyphic shapes, but have no associated name.</p>
    <p>Named character sequences can, in principle, consist of code point 
    sequences of any length, without constraints on what types of characters are 
    involved. They do not have a specifically defined glyphic shape, but they <i>
    do</i> have a formally specified name associated with them.</p>
	<h2 class="section"><a name="Notation">2 Definitions and Notation</a></h2>
	<i>SD1&nbsp; Unicode named character sequence:</i> A specific sequence of two or 
            more Unicode characters, together with a formal name designating 
            that sequence.<p></p>
    <p>The notation for a Unicode named character sequence consists of the 
    general conventions for character sequences in<i> Appendix A, Notational 
	Conventions,</i> of [<a href="../tr41/tr41-3.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>], together with 
    name conventions as specified in <span class="section">Section </span><span class="secno">4,</span> <i><a href="tr34-7.html#Names">Names</a></i>. Thus a typical representation of a Unicode named character sequence 
	would be</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>&lt;U+012B, U+0300&gt; LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH MACRON AND GRAVE</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p></p>
    <p>In contexts that supply other clear means for delimitation, such as data 
	files or tables, the bracketing and comma delimitation conventions for the 
	sequences may be dropped, as in</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>012B 0300;LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH MACRON AND GRAVE</p>
	</blockquote>
	<div class="book-only"><p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p></div>
	<h2 class="section"><a name="Conformance">3 Conformance</a></h2>
	<p>Conformance to the Unicode Standard <i>requires</i> 
	conformance to the specification in this annex. The relationship between 
	conformance to the Unicode Standard and conformance to an individual Unicode 
	Standard Annex (UAX) is described in more detail 
	in <i>Section 3.2, Conformance Requirements,</i> in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-3.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]. </p>
	<i><b>UAX34-C1:</b> If a process purports to implement Unicode named 
            character sequences, it shall use only those named character 
            sequences defined in the file NamedSequences.txt in the Unicode 
            Character Database.</i><p>Only the named character sequences in NamedSequences.txt are 
	named in 
    this standard. No other Unicode character sequences are given names in this 
	version of the Unicode Standard, although named character 
	sequences may be added in the future. Only sequences that are in Normalization 
		Form NFC are given names in the Unicode Standard.</p>
    <p>Conformance to this clause should not be construed as preventing 
    implementers from providing informal names of their choice to any entities 
    or character sequences, as appropriate. However, such informal names are not 
    specified in any way by this standard for use in interchange.</p>
	<p>The use of unnamed sequences is not affected by the specifications in 
	this annex.</p>
	<h3 class="section"><a name="ProvProc">3.1 Provisional Process for Named Character Sequences</a></h3>
	<p>When named character sequences are first suggested for inclusion in the 
	Unicode Standard, they may be accepted provisionally. In such cases, they 
	are listed in the file NamedSequencesProv.txt. See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-3.html#DataProv">DataProv</a>].
</p><p>
Character sequences and proposed names listed in
NamedSequencesProv.txt are <i>provisional</i> only
and have no other status. They become part of the
standard itself only when approved for inclusion in NamedSequences.txt.
</p><p>
The use of a provisional list is meant to allow sufficient time
for review and comment on proposed named character
sequences before they are finally approved. This also
enables the normative data file, NamedSequences.txt, to remain stable.
</p>
   	<h2 class="section">4 Names<a name="Names"></a></h2>
	<p>Names of Unicode named character sequences are unique. 
	They are part of the same namespace as Unicode character names. As a 
	result, where a name exists as a character name, a modified name must be 
	assigned instead. The same applies to not-yet-encoded characters.</p>
	<p>Where possible, the names for sequences 
	are constructed by appending the names of the constituent elements together 
	while eliding duplicate elements, and possibly introducing the words between elements for clarity. Where this process would result in a 
	name that already exists, the name is modified suitably to guarantee uniqueness.
	<i>Table 3</i> gives some examples of names for hypothetical sequences 
	constructed according in this manner.</p>
	<div align="center">

	<p>Where names are constructed other than by merging existing character 
	names for the constituent characters of the sequence, convention restricts any 
	additional items to the Latin capital letters A to Z, <span class="name">SPACE</span>, 
	<span class="name">HYPHEN-MINUS,</span> 
	and the digits 0 to 9, provided that a digit is not the first character in a 
	word. This convention makes it possible to turn 
	names into identifiers using straightforward transformations.</p>
	<p>Names for named sequences are constructed 
	according to the following rules:</p>
	<p><i>R1: Only Latin capital letters A to Z, 
	digits 0 to 9 (provided that a digit is not the first character in a word), 
	<span class="name">SPACE</span>, and <span class="name">HYPHEN-MINUS</span> are used for writing the names.</i></p>
	<p><i>R2:&nbsp; Only one name is given to each 
	named sequence, and each named sequence must have a unique name within the namespace that 
	named sequences share with character names.</i> </p>
	<p><i>R3:&nbsp; Like character names, names 
	for sequences are unique if they are different even when <span class="name">SPACE</span> and medial 
	<span class="name">HYPHEN-MINUS</span> characters are ignored, and when the strings “LETTER”, 
	“CHARACTER”, and “DIGIT” are ignored in comparison of the names.</i></p>
	<p>The following two character names are exceptions to this rule, because 
	they were created before this rule was specified:</p>
<p>116C HANGUL JUNGSEONG OE<br>
	1180 HANGUL JUNGSEONG O-E</p>
	<p>Examples of unacceptable names that are not 
	unique:</p>
<p>SARATI LETTER AA<br>
	SARATI CHARACTER AA</p>
	<p>These two names would not be unique if the 
	strings “LETTER” and “CHARACTER” were ignored.</p>
	<p><i>R4: Where possible, names for named sequences are constructed by 
    appending the names of the constituent elements together while eliding 
    duplicate elements, and possibly introducing the words “WITH” 
    or “AND” 
    between elements for clarity. Should this process result in a name that 
    already exists, the name is modified suitably to guarantee uniqueness among 
    character names and names for named sequences.&nbsp;</i> 
	</p>
	<p><i>R5: Where applicable, the rules from Appendix L in ISO/IEC 
	10646:2003 apply.</i></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><span class="note">Note:</span> Just like character names, the names for sequences may be translated, with the translated 
	names for each language being unique with respect to each other and the corresponding 
	set of translated character names. However, translated names are not restricted to the same limited character 
	set as the English names. Translated names may not be suitable as 
	identifiers without modification.</p>
</blockquote>
