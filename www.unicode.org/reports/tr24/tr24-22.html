  <h4 class="summary">Summary</h4>
  <p><i>This annex describes two related Unicode code point properties.
        Both properties share the use of Script property values. The Script property itself assigns single
        script values to all Unicode code points, identifying a primary script association, where possible.
        The Script_Extensions property assigns sets of Script property values, providing more detail
        for cases where characters are commonly used with multiple scripts.
        This information is useful in mechanisms such as regular expressions 
	and other text processing tasks, as
        explained in the description of the usage model for these properties.</i></p>

  <h2 class="section"><a name="Introduction" href="tr24-22.html#Introduction">1</a> Introduction</h2>
  
        <p>This annex defines two properties, Script and Script_Extensions, which
        can be used to describe the relation of individual Unicode characters
        to their use within the context of one or more scripts, in the case
        of ordinary, common writing.</p>
        
        <p>The glossary definition of "script", in the sense used in the
        Unicode Standard [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>], is as follows:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
	<p><em><a name="script" href="tr24-22.html#script">Script</a></em>: A collection of symbols used to 
	represent textual information in one or more writing systems.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The majority of characters encoded in the Unicode Standard belong to scripts. Exceptions include symbols
        and punctuation characters intended for use with 
        arbitrary scripts, and characters intended to be used 
	in combination with other characters.</p>
        
	<p>Text in a given script consists of characters from that script, together 
	with shared punctuation, symbols, and dependent characters whose script identity depends on the 
	characters with which they are used.</p>
	
	<h3 class="section"><a name="Classification" href="tr24-22.html#Classification">1.1</a> Classification of 
	Text by Script Property</h3>
	
	<p>The Unicode Character Database 
  	[<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#UCD">UCD</a>] provides a mapping from Unicode characters to 
  	Script property values. 
  This information is useful for a 
	variety of tasks that need to analyze a piece of text and determine what 
	parts of it are in which script. Examples include regular expressions or 
	assigning different fonts to parts of a plain text stream based on the 
	prevailing script.</p>
	<p>These processes are similar to the task of bibliographers in cataloging documents by their 
	script. However, bibliographers often ignore small inclusions of other scripts in 
	the form of 
	quoted material in cataloging. Conversely, significant 
	differences in the writing style for the same script may be reflected in the 
	bibliographical classification—for example, Fraktur or Gaelic for the Latin script.</p>
	<p>Script information is also taken into consideration 
	in collation. The data in the Default Unicode Collation Element Table (DUCET) 
	is grouped by script, so that letters of different scripts have 
	different primary sort weights. However, numbers, symbols, and punctuation are not 
	grouped with the letters. For the purposes of ordering, therefore, script is 
	most significant for the letters. For more information, see Unicode 
	Technical Standard #10, “Unicode Collation Algorithm”
	[<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#UTS10">UTS10</a>].</p>
	<p>These examples demonstrate that 
	the definition of <i>script</i> depends on the intended purposes 
	of the classification. <i><a href="tr24-22.html#Classification_Table">Table 1</a></i> summarizes 
	some of the purposes for which text elements can be classified by 
	script.</p>

  </div>
	<p>Bibliographical, graphological, or historical 
	classifications of scripts need different distinctions than the type of 
	text-processing–related needs supported by Unicode Script property values. The 
	requirements of the task not only affect how fine-grained the classification is, but also 
	what 
	kinds of special values are needed to make the system work. For example, when 
	bibliographers are unable to determine the script of a document, they may 
	classify it using a special value for <b>Unknown</b>. In text processing, 
	the identities of all characters are normally known, but some characters may 
	be 
	shared across scripts or attached to any character, thus requiring 
	special values for <b>Common</b> and <b>Inherited</b>.</p>
	<p>Despite these differences, the vast majority of 
	Unicode Script property values correspond more or less directly to the script identifiers used by bibliographers 
	and others. Unicode Script property values are therefore mapped to their equivalents 
	in the registry of script codes defined 
	by [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#ISO15924">ISO15924</a>].</p>

	<h3 class="section"><a name="Scripts_and_Blocks" href="tr24-22.html#Scripts_and_Blocks">1.2</a> Scripts and Blocks</h3>
	
	<p>Unicode characters are also divided into non-overlapping ranges called 
	blocks 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#Blocks">Blocks</a>]. Many of these blocks have the same name as one of the scripts 
	because 
	characters of that script are primarily encoded in that block. 
	However, blocks and scripts differ in the following 
	ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blocks are simply ranges, and often contain code points that are unassigned.</li>
    <li>Characters from the same script may be in several different blocks.</li>
    <li>Characters from different scripts may be in the same block.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As a result, for mechanisms such as regular expressions, using Script property values produces 
	more meaningful results than simple matches based on block names. </p>
  <p>For more information, see <i>Annex A, Character Blocks</i>, in 
	Unicode Technical Standard #18, "Unicode Regular Expressions" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#UTS18">UTS18</a>].</p>

	<h3><a name="ScriptX" href="tr24-22.html#ScriptX">1.3</a> Script Extensions</h3>
        
        <p>Many characters are shared among several scripts, but without
        the generic usage normally implied by simply assigning the script
        property value of <b>Common</b> to the character. <i><a href="tr24-22.html#Scx_Example_Table">Table 2</a></i>
        gives examples of such characters. U+30FC is shared across the Hiragana and
        Katakana scripts, but is not used in other scripts. U+0640 ARABIC TATWEEL is used
        in Mandaic, Syriac, Manichaean, and Psalter Pahlavi, as well as the Arabic script.</p>

        <p>Where a character is commonly used in the context of
        several scripts, and where the list of those scripts can be explicitly
        enumerated, such usage can be documented with
        the Script_Extensions property. For details, see
        the discussion in <i><a href="tr24-22.html#Script_Extensions">Section 2.9</a></i> and
        <i><a href="tr24-22.html#Assignment_ScriptX_Values">Section 3.3</a></i>.</p> 
	
	<h3><a name="Out_of_Scope" href="tr24-22.html#Out_of_Scope">1.4</a> Usage Not Reflected in the Script Property</h3>
        
        <p>Many characters are regularly used out of their normal contexts
        for specialized purposes&#x2014;for example, for pedagogical use or as part of
        mathematical, scientific, or scholarly notations. Such uses are not reflected in
        the assignment of values for either the Script or Script_Extensions properties,
        because those properties aim rather to reflect ordinary and common usage of
        characters with a script (or set of scripts). Implementations are cautioned
        that such "out-of-context" usage of characters does exist and needs to be
        supported where required, regardless of the Script and Script_Extensions
        property values for a given character.</p>
	
        <h2 class="section"><a name="Usage_Model" href="tr24-22.html#Usage_Model">2</a> Usage Model</h2>
	
  <h3 class="section"><a name="Special_Explicit" href="tr24-22.html#Special_Explicit">2.1</a> Special vs. Explicit 
	Script Property Values</h3>

  <p>The Script property values form a full partition of the codespace: every code point 
	is assigned a single Script property value. This value is
  either the value for a specific script, such 
  as <b>Cyrillic,</b> or is one of the following three special values:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Inherited</b>—for 
		characters that may be used with multiple scripts, and that inherit their 
		script from the preceding characters. These include nonspacing marks, 
		enclosing marks, and the zero width joiner/non-joiner characters. 
		</li>
		<li><b>Common</b>—for other 
		characters that may be used with multiple scripts. </li>
		<li><b>Unknown</b>—for 
		unassigned, private-use, 
		noncharacter, and surrogate code points.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>All other Script property values 
	are referred to as <i>explicit</i> script values, because they each refer to one specific
	script.</p>
	<p>As new scripts are 
	added to the standard, more Script property values will be added. See 
	<span class="section">Section </span><span class="secno">3.2,</span> 
  <i><a href="tr24-22.html#Assignment_Script_Values">Assignment of Script Property Values</a>.</i></p>
	
	<p>If a character is regularly used only with a single script, it is given that
        specific Script property value (as opposed to <b>Common</b> or <b>Inherited</b>). This facilitates the 
	use of the script property for common tasks such as regular expressions, but 
	it also means that some characters that are definite members of a given script, 
	based on their forms and history, nevertheless are assigned one of the generic values. As more data on the usage of individual characters 
	is collected, the Script property value assigned to a character may change. 
	Rarely would a character change from one specific script
	to another. However, if it 
	becomes established that a character is regularly used with more than one 
	script, it will be assigned the <b>Common</b> 
	or <b>Inherited</b> Script property value. Similarly, if it becomes
	established that a character is regularly used with only a single, specific script,
	it will be assigned a specific Script property value. The occasional use of character from one script
	in the context of another script, as for instance the citation of a Greek letter
	used as a mathematical constant in the midst of Latin text, or the use of a Latin
	letter in the midst of Han text, is not considered sufficient evidence of
	"regular use" requiring a designation of <b>Common</b> Script property value.
	It is also possible for a character, once given a <b>Common</b> or <b>Inherited</b>
	Script property value, upon further research, to be changed to a specific script,
	instead.</p>
	
	<p>The <b>Common</b> Script property value only indicates
	that a character is used with multiple scripts, but supplies no information
	about which particular scripts those are. For many applications such a coarse classification may be
	insufficient; they require further detailed information. For example, a character picker
	application which organizes characters into visual buckets by script may need to
	show a <b>Common</b> script character in two or more buckets, depending on which
	particular scripts use that character. Such supplementary classification will
	depend on the particular usage and is not provided as a
	normative or informative property in the Unicode
	Character Database. See <i>Section 2.8, 
	<a href="tr24-22.html#Multiple_Script_Values">Multiple Script Values</a></i>.</p>
	
  <h3 class="section"><a name="Common" href="tr24-22.html#Common">2.2</a> Handling Characters with the Common 
	Script Property</h3>
	
	<p>In determining the boundaries of a run of text in a 
	given script, programs must
	resolve any of the special Script property values, such 
	as <b>Common,</b> based on the context of the surrounding characters. 
  A simple heuristic uses the script of the preceding character, which 
  works well in many cases. However, this may not always produce optimal 
  results. For example, in the text “... gamma (γ) is ...”, this 
  heuristic would cause matching parentheses to be in different scripts. </p>
  
	<p>Generally, paired punctuation, such as brackets or quotation marks, belongs 
	to the enclosing or outer level of the text and should therefore match the 
	script of the enclosing text. In addition, opening and closing elements of a 
	pair resolve to the same Script property values, where possible. The use of quotation 
	marks is language dependent; therefore it is not possible to tell from the 
	character code alone whether a particular quotation mark is used as an 
	opening or closing punctuation. For more information, see <i>Section 6.2, 
	General Punctuation,</i> of [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
	<p>Some characters that are normally 
	used as paired punctuation may also be used singly. An example is U+2019
	RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK, which is also used as
	<i>apostrophe,</i> in which case it no longer acts as an enclosing 
	punctuation. An example from physics would be &lt;<span class="mathsym2">ψ</span>| 
	or |<span class="mathsym2">ψ</span>&gt;, where the enclosing 
	punctuation characters may not form consistent pairs.</p>
	
	<h3 class="section"><a name="Nonspacing_Marks" href="tr24-22.html#Nonspacing_Marks">2.3</a> Handling Combining Marks</h3>
	
	<p>Implementations that determine the boundaries between 
	characters of given scripts should never break between a combining mark (a character with General_Category value of Mc, Mn or Me) and its base 
	character. Thus, for boundary determinations and similar sorts of processing, 
	a combining mark—whatever its Script property value—should inherit the script 
	property value of its base character. Spacing combining marks are typically only used 
	with one script and have the corresponding Script property value.</p>
	<p>The nonspacing marks normally have the  
	<b>Inherited</b> Script property value to 
      reflect the fact that their Script property value depends on the base character. 
      However, in cases where the best interpretation of a 
      nonspacing mark <i>in isolation</i> would be a specific script, its 
      Script property value may be different from <b>Inherited</b>. 
	For example, the Hebrew marks and 
	accents are used only with Hebrew characters and are therefore assigned the
	<b>Hebrew</b> Script property value.</p>

        <p>The recommended implementation strategy is to treat all the characters of
        a combining character sequence, including spacing combining marks, as
        having the Script property value of the first character in the sequence. This
        strategy can also be applied to implementations that use extended grapheme
        clusters; the differences between combining character
        sequences and extended
        grapheme clusters are not material for script resolution. For
        example, rendering generally works
        best if an entire combining character sequence can be treated as a segment
        having a single script, using one set of orthographic rules, and ideally
        using a single font for display. Because
        of this recommended strategy, even if a combining mark is really only used
        with a single script, it makes little difference in practice whether the
        mark has that particular Script property value or <b>Inherited</b>.</p>
        
        <p>In cases where the first (base) character itself 
        has the <b>Common</b> Script property value, and it is followed by one or more combining
        marks with a specific Script property value, such as the Hebrew marks, it may
        be even better for processing to let the base acquire the Script property value from the
        first mark. This would be the case, for example, if using a graphic symbol as
        a base to illustrate the placement of nonspacing marks in a particular script.
        This approach can be generalized by treating all the characters of a combining character
        sequence (or extended grapheme cluster)
        as having the Script property value of the first non-<b>Inherited</b>,
        non-<b>Common</b> character in the sequence if
        there is one, and otherwise treating all the characters as having the
        <b>Common</b> Script property value. See <i>Section 2.8, 
	<a href="tr24-22.html#Multiple_Script_Values">Multiple Script Values</a></i>.</p>
        
        <p>Note that exceptional fallback for rendering may
        be required for defective combining character sequences or in some cases where
        a base character and a combining mark have different specific Script property values.
        For example, there may simply be no felicitous way to display a Devanagari
        combining vowel on a Mongolian consonant base.</p>
        
	<h3 class="section"><a name="Script_Names_in_RegEx" href="tr24-22.html#Script_Names_in_RegEx">2.4</a> Using Script 
	Property Values in Regular Expressions</h3>
	
  <p>The script property is useful in regular expression syntax for easy 
	specification of spans of text that consist of a single script or mixture 
	of scripts. In general, regular expressions should use specific Script property values 
	only in conjunction 
  with both <b>Common</b> and <b>Inherited</b>. For example, to distinguish a 
  sequence of characters appropriate for Greek text, one would use</p>
  <p align="center"><code>((Greek | Common) (Inherited | 
  Me | Mn)?)*</code></p>
  <p>The preceding expression matches all characters that 
  have a Script property value of <b>Greek</b> or <b>Common</b> 
	and which are 
  optionally followed by characters  
  with a Script property value of <b>Inherited</b>. For completeness, the 
	regular expression also allows any nonspacing or enclosing mark. </p>
	<p>Some languages commonly use 
  multiple scripts, so, for example, to distinguish
  a sequence of characters appropriate for Japanese text one might use:</p>
  <p align="center"><code>((Hiragana | Katakana | Han | Latin | Common) 
  (Inherited | Me | Mn)?)*</code></p>
	<p>Note that while it is necessary to include <b>Latin</b> 
	in the preceding expression to ensure that it can cover the typical script use 
	found in many Japanese texts, doing so would make it difficult 
	to isolate a run of Japanese inside an English document, for example. For more information, see Unicode Technical Standard 
	#18, “Unicode Regular Expressions” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#UTS18">UTS18</a>].</p>
        
    <p>The assignment of a Script property value, and in particular of
    a Script_Extensions property value, is not guaranteed to be stable. The most
    recently published values always represent the best information available at
    the time of publication. It is important not to use the Script or Script_Extensions
    properties in regular expressions if the goal is to match a reproducible, fixed
    set of characters across versions of the Unicode Standard.</p>

  <h3 class="section"><a name="Script_Names_in_Rendering" href="tr24-22.html#Script_Names_in_Rendering">2.5</a> Use of the Script Property in Rendering Systems</h3>
  
    <p>In rendering systems, it is generally necessary to respect a certain set 
    of orthographic and typographic rules, which vary across the world. For 
    example, the placement of some diacritics which are nominally rendered above 
    their base may be adjusted to be slightly on the side, as is normally 
    the case for Greek. Another example of variation in rendering is the treatment of spaces in 
    justification. In the absence of an explicit specification of those 
    rules, the Script property value of the characters involved provides a good first
    approximation. Typically, a rendering system will partition a text 
    string into segments of homogeneous script (after resolution of the <b>Common</b> 
    and <b>Inherited</b> occurrences along the lines described in the previous 
    sections), and then apply the rules appropriate to the script of each 
    segment.</p>

  <h3 class="section"><a name="Limitations" href="tr24-22.html#Limitations">2.6</a> Limitations</h3>
  
	<p>The script property 
  values form a full partition of the Unicode codespace, but that partition 
  does not exhaust the possibilities for useful and relevant script-like subsets 
  of Unicode characters.</p>
  <p>For example, a user might wish to define a regular expression to span 
  typical mathematical expressions, but the subset of Unicode characters used in 
  mathematics does not correspond to any particular script. Instead, it requires 
  use of the <b>Math</b> property, other character properties, and particular 
  subsets of Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic letters. For information on other 
  character properties, see [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#UCD">UCD</a>].</p>
	<p>In texts of an academic, 
	scientific, or engineering nature, 
	Greek characters are frequently used in isolation—for example,	Ω for ohm; α, β, and γ for types of 
	radioactive decays or in names of chemical compounds; π for 3.1415..., and 
	so on. 
	It is generally undesirable to treat such usage the same as ordinary text in the Greek script. 
	Some commonly used 
	characters, such as µ, already exist twice in the Unicode Standard, but with 
	different Script property values.</p>
	
  <h3 class="section"><a name="Spoofing" href="tr24-22.html#Spoofing">2.7</a> Spoofing</h3>
  
	<p>The Script property values may also be useful in 
  providing users feedback to signal possible spoofing, where 
  visually similar characters (<i>confusable characters</i>) are substituted in 
  an attempt to mislead a user. For example, a domain name such as <code>macchiato.com</code> 
  could be spoofed with <code>macchiatο.com</code> (using U+03BF GREEK LETTER SMALL 
	LETTER OMICRON for the first “o”) 
  or <code>maссhiato.com</code> (using U+0441 CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER ES for the first 
	two “c”s). The user can 
  be alerted to odd cases by displaying mixed scripts with different colors, 
  highlighting, or boundary marks: <code>macchiat<span class="lightyellow">ο</span>.com</code> 
  or <code>ma<span class="lightyellow">сс</span>hiato.com</code>, for example.</p>
  <p>Possible spoofing is not limited to mixtures of 
  scripts. Even in ASCII, there are confusable characters such as 0 and O, or 1 
  and l. For a more complete approach, the use of Script property values needs to be augmented with other 
  information such as General_Category values and lists of 
  individual characters that are not distinguished by other Unicode properties.

	Considerations” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#UTR36">UTR36</a>].</p>
	
  <h3><a name="Multiple_Script_Values" href="tr24-22.html#Multiple_Script_Values"></a>2.8 Multiple Script Values</h3>
  
  <p>If a character is regularly used only with a single script,
  it is given that specific Script property value; otherwise, the Script property value 
  is either <b>Common</b> or <b>Inherited</b>. These property values do not 
  indicate <em>which</em> scripts a character is used with, only that the character is 
  used with more than one script. For example, U+0660 ( ٠ ) ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ZERO is 
  used both with Arabic and with Syriac; similarly, U+30FC ( ー ) KATAKANA-HIRAGANA PROLONGED 
  SOUND MARK is shared between Hiragana and Katakana. Neither character is typically used with 
  other scripts, such as Latin or Greek.</p>
  <p>More precise information about the use of a character with multiple 
  scripts is important for a number of different kinds of processing. The following examples 
  illustrate such cases:</p>
<p><strong>Example 1.</strong> Mixed script detection for spoofing.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Using the Unicode script property alone, for example, will not detect that neither U+0660 ( ٠ ) ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ZERO  nor  U+30FC ( ー ) KATAKANA-HIRAGANA PROLONGED SOUND MARK should  be mixed with Latin. See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#UTS39">UTS39</a>] and [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#UTS46">UTS46</a>].</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 2.</strong> Determination of script runs for text layout.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The <b>Common</b> characters listed in Example 1 should not continue a Latin script run, but  instead should only continue runs of  certain scripts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 3.</strong> Regex property testing.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For many common tasks, the regex expression [:script=Arab:] is too narrow, 
  because it does not include U+0660 ( ٠ ) ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ZERO, but the 
  expression [[:script=Arab:][:script=Common:]] is far too broad, because it also includes 
  thousands of symbols, plus the U+30FC ( ー ) KATAKANA-HIRAGANA PROLONGED SOUND MARK. 
  A regex engine can instead specify a regular expression like [:scx=Arab:], which matches 
  based on both the Script property value and the extended script 
  data, and which would include characters such as U+0660 ( ٠ ) ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ZERO. For
  more information, see Unicode Technical Standard #18, 
  "Unicode Regular Expressions" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#UTS18">UTS18</a>].</p>
</blockquote>

  <h3><a name="Script_Extensions" href="tr24-22.html#Script_Extensions"></a>2.9 Script_Extensions Property</h3>
  
  <p>Many of the characters that are assigned a Script property value of <b>Common</b> or
  <b>Inherited</b> are not commonly used with
  <i>all</i> scripts, but rather only with a limited set of scripts.
  The Script_Extensions property is designed to support tasks,
  such as those outlined above, where it is desirable to know more
  precisely in which script context such characters can be expected to occur in common use.</p>
   
  <p>Unlike the Script property, the
  Script_Extensions property consists of a set of values for each character.
  The Script_Extensions property is primarily 
  targeted at customary modern use of characters, and does not encompass technical usage such 
  as UPA or math. Its values are based on 
  the best available knowledge of usage, which may 
  change over time. The values can be expected to change more frequently than many other Unicode 
  character properties, as more information is gleaned about the usage of given characters. 
  Thus, implementers should be prepared for enhancements and corrections to 
  the values whenever they upgrade to a new version of the property.</p>
   
  <p>The vast
  majority of characters in the standard are used with only a single script. For those characters,
  the Script_Extensions property value is a set containing as its single member the
  Script property value for that character.</p>
  
  <p>Occasionally, even characters that have a Script property value of <b>Common</b> or
  <b>Inherited</b> might have a Script_Extensions property value containing only a
  single script. This does not mean that those characters are
  used soley with a single script&#x2014;rather, such characters are known or strongly suspected of being
  used with multiple scripts. However, reliable information is lacking regarding
  which other scripts belong in this set. The Script_Extensions property
  for such characters will be updated in future versions of the standard, if the missing
  information becomes available.</p>
   
  <p>Conversely, characters for which the Script_Extensions property
  value contains multiple Script property values typically have a Script property value of
  either <b>Common</b> or <b>Inherited</b>.
  However, in some cases, a character belonging to a particular script may
  be borrowed for use with one or more other scripts. While the Script property value
  for such a borrowed character would be the same as the script it is primarily used with, the Script_Extensions
  property value at times will also include additional scripts. As a result, there is no guarantee that it will always
  be true that:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <pre>
Script_Extensions(c) &#x2260; {Script(c)} &#x2192; (Script(c) = <b>Common</b>) &#x2228; (Script(c) = <b>Inherited</b>)</pre>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>The Script_Extensions property values are given in the file ScriptExtensions.txt in the Unicode Character 
  Database [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#UCD">UCD</a>].</p>

<h2 class="section"><a name="Values" href="tr24-22.html#Values">3</a> Values</h2>

  such as matching spans of similar characters in regular expressions.</p>
  
  <h3 class="section"><a name="Relation_To_ISO15924" href="tr24-22.html#Relation_To_ISO15924"></a>3.1 Relation to ISO 15924 
	Codes</h3>
	
	<p> ISO 
  15924: <i>Code for the Representation of Names of Scripts</i> [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#ISO15924">ISO15924</a>] provides an enumeration of 
    four-letter script codes. In the [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#UCD">UCD</a>] file [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#PropValue">PropValue</a>], 
  corresponding codes from [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#ISO15924">ISO15924</a>] are provided as short names for the scripts.</p>
	<p>In some cases the match between these Script property values 
    and the ISO 15924 codes is not precise, because the goals are somewhat 
    different. ISO 15924 is aimed primarily at the bibliographic identification 
    of scripts; consequently, it occasionally identifies varieties of scripts 
    that may be useful for book cataloging, but that are not considered 
    distinct scripts in the Unicode Standard. For example, ISO 15924 has 
    separate script codes for the Fraktur and Gaelic varieties of the Latin 
    script.</p>
	<p>Where there are no corresponding ISO 15924 codes,  
    private-use codes starting with the letter Q are used. Such 
    values are likely to change in the future. In such a case, the Q-names will 
    be retained as aliases in the file [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#PropValue">PropValue</a>] 
    for backward compatibility. For example, the older Script property value Qaai was retained 
    as an alias for <b>Inherited</b>, when the newly defined script code Zinh was added to ISO 15924
    and used as the preferred short name for <b>Inherited</b> in Unicode 5.2.</p>

	Assignment of Script Property Values</h3>
	
	<p>New characters and scripts are continually added to the 
	Unicode Standard. The following 
	principle determines the assignment of Script property values 
	for existing
	characters and for characters that are newly added to the Unicode Standard:</p>
	<div class="book-only"><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
	<ol type="A">
		<li>
		If a character is only regularly used in one script, 
		it takes the Script property value for that script</li>
	<li>Otherwise, nonspacing marks (Mn, Me) and zero width joiner/non-joiner are
	<b>Inherited</b></li>
	<li>Otherwise, use <b>Common</b>
	</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Script values are not immutable. As more data on the usage of 
	individual characters is collected, script values may be reassigned using 
	the above methodology.</p>
	
	<h3 class="section"><a name="Assignment_ScriptX_Values" href="tr24-22.html#Assignment_ScriptX_Values"></a>3.3
	Assignment of Script_Extensions Property Values</h3>
	
	<p>The following 
	principle determines the assignment of Script_Extensions property values 
	for existing
	characters and for characters that are newly added to the Unicode Standard:</p>
	<div class="book-only"><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
	<ol type="A">
        <li>If a character has the Script property value of <b>Common</b>
        or <b>Inherited</b>, and in principle might occur with almost any script,
        its Script_Extensions is also {<b>Common</b>} or {<b>Inherited</b>}, respectively</li>
	<li>If a character is regularly used in more than one script,
                but such usage is limited to a small, enumerable list, then 
		the character takes the Script_Extensions property value consisting of the set of
                Script property values for each of those scripts</li>
	<li>Otherwise, the Script_Extensions property value defaults to a set containing
        a single value, the Script property value for that code point</li>
	</ol>
        
        <p>Examples of characters that have the Script property value of <b>Common</b>
        or <b>Inherited</b>, but in principle might occur with almost any script, would
        include many symbol characters. They simply get a Script_Extensions
        default value of {<b>Common</b>} or {<b>Inherited</b>}. Only when the common usage
        consists of a relatively small and well-determined list of scripts is it useful to
        enumerate that set explicitly for a Script_Extensions property value. In many
        cases such sets may involve shared typographical traditions between neighboring or
        related scripts.</p>
	<p>Script_Extensions property values are not immutable. As more data on the usage of 
	individual characters is collected, Script_Extensions property values may be adjusted.
        This may occur either as a result of the Script property value for the character
        being changed, or as a result of a determination that a given character is used
        with more (or fewer) scripts than earlier determined.</p>
	
	<h3 class="section"><a name="Script_Designators" href="tr24-22.html#Script_Designators"></a>3.4 Script 
	Designators in Character and Block Names</h3>
	
	<p>Many character names contain a script designator
	as their first element(s). For example:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li><b>LATIN</b> SMALL LETTER S
	<li><b>KATAKANA</b> LETTER SA
	<li><b>NEW TAI LUE</b> LETTER LOW SA
	<li><b>PHAGS-PA</b> LETTER SA
	</ul>
	
	<p>Character names are guaranteed to be unique even when ignoring case
	differences and the presence of SPACE 
	or HYPHEN-MINUS. Underscores are not
	used in character names. In practice, this means that
	script designators are also unique, and, because
	they are a part of character names, they are limited to 
	the same characters used in character names:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Latin letters A–Z</li>
		<li>Digits 0–9</li>
		<li>SPACE and medial HYPHEN-MINUS</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Digits do not actually occur in script designators used
        in character names.</p>
        
	<p>Many block names, for example, "Latin-1 Supplement", also
	contain script designators. These script designators are closely (but not precisely)
	aligned with the script designators used for character names in the corresponding
	blocks. Similar restrictions apply to script designators as part of 
	block names, except that there is no restriction on
	the case of letters.</p>
	
	<h3 class="section"><a name="Script_Value_Aliases" href="tr24-22.html#Script_Value_Aliases"></a>3.5
	Script Property Value Aliases</h3>
	
	<p>In addition to short names derived from ISO 15924 script codes,
	as discussed in <i>Section 3.1, <a href="tr24-22.html#Relation_To_ISO15924">Relation to ISO 15924 Codes</a></i>, each Script property value is also given a long name as a script
	property value alias. These long names are also listed in 
	the [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#UCD">UCD</a>] file [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#PropValue">PropValue</a>].
	They are constructed to be appropriate for use as identifiers. The long or short
	property value aliases are the identifiers that should
	be used in regular expressions and similar usages.</p>

	<p>Except for the special Script property values such as
	<b>Common</b> and <b>Inherited</b>, the long name aliases usually correspond to the
	script designators, with the replacement of SPACE 
	or HYPHEN-MINUS by underscores, and titlecasing
	each subpart of the resulting identifier, for consistency with the conventions used
	for aliases for other Unicode character properties. For example:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li><b>Latin</b>
	<li><b>Katakana</b>
	<li><b>New_Tai_Lue</b>
	<li><b>Phags_Pa</b>

        <p>As for all property aliases, Script property value aliases

        See the Character Encoding Stability Policies [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#Stability">Stability</a>]
        for details. When comparing Script property value aliases, loose matching criteria
        which ignore case differences and the presence of spaces, hyphens, and underscores,
        should be used. See <i>Section 5.9, Matching Rules</i>, in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#UAX44">UAX44</a>]
        for explanation of loose matching criteria.</p>
        
	<h3 class="section"><a name="Script_Names" href="tr24-22.html#Script_Names"></a>3.6 Script Names</h3>
	
	<p>The term <i>script name</i> is no longer used as part of
	the formal specification of the Unicode script property because it tends to
	be used informally in several ambiguous senses:</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li>To designate the orthographic name of a script in the Unicode Standard.
            For example: <b>chirilică</b>, <b>Кириллица</b>, or <b>キリル文字</b> for <b>Cyrillic</b> (Cyrl).
	    Even in English, such names may occasionally include characters not allowed in script
	    designators or Script property values. For example: <b>Hanun&oacute;o</b> 
	    or <b>N'Ko</b></li>
	<li>To designate any variety of writing, some of which may have ISO 15924
	    script variety codes, such as the <b>Gaelic</b> script, and some of which
	    may not, such as the <b>Hebrew Cursive</b> script.
	<li>As a synonym of the term <i>script designator</i> as it appears in
	    character or block names. For example: <b>HANUNOO</b>
	    or <b>NKO</b></li>
	<li>As a synonym of the long name alternate of <i>Script property value aliases</i>. 
	    For example: <b>Hanunoo</b> (as opposed to the script code <b>Hano</b>) or <b>Nko</b>
	    (as opposed to the script code <b>Nkoo</b>)</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Because of these ambiguities, in Unicode contexts where precision
	of denotation is required, use of the terms <i>Script property value</i> or
	<i>script designator</i>, whichever may be appropriate, is preferred.</p>
        
	<h3 class="section"><a name="Script_Anomalies" href="tr24-22.html#Script_Anomalies"></a>3.7 Script Anomalies</h3>
        
    <p>There are a number of compatibility symbols derived from East Asian character sets
      which have the Script property value <b>Common</b> but whose compatibility decompositions
      contain characters with other Script property values. In particular, the parenthesized ideographs,
      circled ideographs, Japanese era name symbols, and Chinese telegraph symbols
      in the 3200..33FF range contain Han ideographs, and the squared Latin abbreviation
      symbols in the same range contain Latin (and occasional Greek) letters. Examples
      of such characters are listed in <i><a href="tr24-22.html#Common_EastAsian_Table">Table 4</a></i>. 
      Some of these characters have different scripts in their compatibility 
      decompositions. This means that script extents calculated on the basis of the script property
      value of the symbols themselves will differ from script extents calculated on
      NFKD normalized text, in which these characters decompose into sequences including
      the Han and/or Latin characters.</p>

    <p>The UTC has determined that because these symbols may be used with multiple
      scripts in Chinese, Japanese, and/or Korean contexts, their Script property value should
      simply be left as <b>Common</b>. There are other, more reliable clues about
      the behavior of these compatibility symbols, such as their association with
      East Asian character sets, which can be used by rendering systems to assure
      their appropriate display and appropriate font choice. This determination is
      somewhat different from that for the more script-specific parenthesized and
      circled Hangul and Katakana symbols in the same range, which <i>are</i> given
      specific Script property values. Examples of such
      characters are shown in <i><a href="tr24-22.html#Common_KanaHangul_Table">Table 5</a></i>.</p>

      <p>There are other symbols not constrained to primary use in East Asian contexts,
      which have the <b>Common</b> script, but where some users would expect to have a specific
      script. Examples are shown in <i><a href="tr24-22.html#Common_Other_Table">Table 6</a></i>. Symbols in such cases are assigned to the <b>Common</b> script
      because they may be used with a wide variety of scripts, and are not
      necessarily limited to the script values of their compatibility decompositions.</p>

      <p>At this point keeping the Script property value stable for
      these compatibility symbols is more useful for implementers than attempting
      to reconcile these distinctions in treatment by modifying values for them. 
      Implementations that wish to have Script property values that are preserved over
      compatibility equivalence would tailor the Script property values for these
      characters.</p>

<h2 class="section"><a name="Data_File" href="tr24-22.html#Data_File">4</a> Data Files</h2>
	
  <p>The data files associated with the Unicode script property are available at [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#Data24">Data24</a>].  </p>
  <h4>Scripts.txt </h4>
  <p>The format of this file is similar to that of Blocks.txt 
    [<a href="../tr41/tr41-15.html#Blocks">Blocks</a>]. The fields are separated by semicolons. The 
    first field contains either a single code point or the first and last code 
    points in a range separated by “..”. The second field provides the script property
    value for that range. The comment (after a #) indicates the General_Category and the character name. For each range, it gives the character count in square 
    brackets and uses the names for the first and last characters in the range. 
    For example:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>0B01;       Oriya # Mn       ORIYA SIGN CANDRABINDU
0B02..0B03; Oriya # Mc   [2] ORIYA SIGN ANUSVARA..ORIYA SIGN VISARGA</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The value <b>Unknown</b> is the default value, given to all code points that are 
  not explicitly mentioned in the data file.</p>
  <h4>ScriptExtensions.txt</h4>
  <p>The format of this data file is similar to Scripts.txt, except 
  that the second field contains a space-delimited list of short Script property values.
  That list defines the set of Script property values which constitute the
  Script_Extension property value for that code point. 
  For example:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre># Script_Extensions=Arab Syrc

064B..0655    ; Arab Syrc # Mn  [11] ARABIC FATHATAN..ARABIC HAMZA BELOW

# Script_Extensions=Arab Mand Mani Phlp Syrc

0640          ; Arab Mand Mani Phlp Syrc # Lm       ARABIC TATWEEL</pre>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>The default value for the Script_Extensions property for a code point not
  explicitly listed in ScriptExtensions.txt is a set containing one value: the Script value
  of that code point.</p>
