&nbsp;<APPLET CODE="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/Sample/CollationApplet.class" CODEBASE="./" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="36"

</APPLET></h1>

<p>This page contains a simple demonstration of collation code using for the <i><a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr10/">Unicode
Collation Algorithm</a>. </i>The source for this was written in Java, and can be
found at <a HREF="DemoCollation.java">source</a>. (If your browser doesn't
display the source properly, choose the <b>View&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Source</b>  menu.)</p>

<h2><a name="Operation">Operation</a> </h2>

<P>Hit the <b>Load</b> button above. (If you don't see a <b>Load</b> button,
there is a problem with Java in your browser.) Once the window opens, you will
see a box labeled <i>Strings</i>  containing sample strings to be sorted. Click on <b> Sort</b> to see the strings in sorted order in the <i>Sorted</i> <b>
</b> box.
The format is as follows:</P>

<pre>ä =&gt; &lt;0061,0308&gt; =&gt; [06C3 0713| 0020 0020| 0070 0002| FFFF FFFF]</pre>

<P>First is the string itself, then its <i><a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/">Normalization
Form D</a></i>, then the (uncompressed) sort key. (To improve Applet download time, I am only loading information (decompositions
and rules) for characters 0000-00FF (excluding most controls) and 0300-03FF.)</P>

<P>You can change the contents of the <i>Strings</i> box to try out different
strings. If your system doesn't let you type in non-ASCII characters, use \uXXXX,
where XXXX is the Unicode codepoint number. For example, a <i> micro sign</i> would be
<b>\u00B5</b>.</P>

<P> The controls above the <i>Sorted</i> box allow you to fine-tune the results of the sort. As you click them on
and off, the strings from the samples will resort.</P>

<UL>
  <LI><b>*=Shifted, *=Blanked, *=Not Ignored: </b> changes the choice of how to handle <i>variables</i>
    (those marked with a * in the Rules). Watch the variants of sample
  strings containing spaces as you click.
  <LI><b>L1, L2, L3, L4: </b> Sets the maximum level to be considered. Watch similar strings
  as you click. Notice that if the level is below the distinction in the
  strings, then each time you hit the Sort button those strings will be randomly
  ordered.
  <LI><b>French: </b> sorts all secondaries backwards. Scroll down to watch the variants of <I>c&ocirc;t&eacute;</I>
  as you click.
</UL>

<h3>Changing Rules </h3>

<P>The <i>Rules</i> box contains a set of rules. If you try changing any of
them, click on <b> Rebuild</b> afterwards.&nbsp;[If you've made any errors, a
message will appear in the bottom box.]</P>

<table border="1" align="right" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">
  <tr>
    <th width="100%">

<P>Sample Rearrangement</P>

    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">qaa<br>

qzz<br>
qza<br>
qz<br>
z</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<P>Rearrangement is used in Thai and Laotian. For illustration, both q and Q are
set to rearrange in the sample rules. To see how it works, copy the sample in
the sidebar into the <i>Strings</i> box, and <b>Sort</b>. You can delete the @rearrange line
to see the difference.</P>

<P>To check out the handling of unsupported characters, you can remove some of
the Rules, add those characters to the String box, and rebuild.&nbsp; For example, delete
the rule for e:</P>

<pre>0065 ; [.0713.0020.0002.0065] # LATIN SMALL LETTER E</pre>

<P>click on <b> Rebuild</b>. Now strings starting with <i><b>e</b></i> will sort
at the end.</P>

<P>The rules in the &quot;Rules&quot; box have some tailored test rules
with contracting characters for testing. These include <I><b>ch</b></I> as in traditional
Spanish, <I><b>&auml;</b></I> <b> </b> as in traditional German, and <I><b>&aring;</b></I> as in
Danish. Notice also that intervening accents don't interfere with successive
contracting accents unless  they are blocked by other accents of the same
canonical class: e.g. with <i><b>a + dot_under + umlaut,</b></i> the <I><b>a-umlaut</b></I>
will form, but in <i><b>a + grave + umlaut,</b></i> the <I><b>grave</b></I> will block
the <I><b>umlaut</b></I>. (Intervening accents always block successive contracting
base characters: e.g. any accent in between will block <I>ch</I> from forming.)</P>

<P>Note that contracting characters must be <i><b>closed</b></i>. That is, if
you have the contracting character in the table, such as <b><i>abc</i></b>, then
any initial substrings of that string (e.g. <b><i>ab </i></b>and <b><i>a</i></b>)
must be present in the table. Otherwise you will get an error. To see this, cut
the line for the letter <b><i>a</i></b> from the Rules box:</P>

<pre>0061 ; [.06C3.0020.0002.0061] # LATIN SMALL LETTER A</pre>

<P>When you click on <b> Rebuild</b>, you get an error. To fix it, paste back
the line for <b><i>a</i></b>, or remove the contracting characters that start
with <b><i>a</i></b>.</P>
