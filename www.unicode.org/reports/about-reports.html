                <h1><a name="About">About Unicode Technical Reports</a></h1>

                <p><a href="index.html">Unicode Technical Reports</a> cover a wide range of   
                topics related to the implementation or development of the   
                Unicode Standard. These include topics such as:</p>      
                <ul>
                  <li>normalizing Unicode text for comparison and storage</li>
                  <li>collating (sorting) Unicode strings</li>
                  <li>determining line break opportunities or other segmentation boundaries in text</li>
                  <li>regular expression syntax extensions for Unicode text</li>
                  <li>compressing Unicode text</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These reports are normatively referenced by a 
                number of international standards and by a wide range of 
                products.</p>
                <p>For a categorized list of the Unicode specifications, including specifications
                  defined in the Unicode Technical Reports and those defined in other locations in the
                  Unicode Standard, see the 
                <a href="http://www.unicode.org/faq/specifications.html">Specifications FAQ</a>.</p>

                <h2><a name="Types">Types</a> of Unicode Technical Reports: UAX, UTS, UTR</h2>

                <p>There are three types of technical reports, 
                based on the authoritative status of the document: <br>
                <blockquote>
                <p>A <b>Unicode Standard Annex (UAX)</b> forms an integral part 
                of the Unicode Standard, but is published as a separate 
                document. The Unicode Standard may require conformance to 
                normative content in a Unicode Standard Annex, if so specified 
                in the Conformance chapter of that version of the Unicode 
                Standard. The version number of a UAX document is always the same as 
                the version of the Unicode Standard of which it forms a part.</p>
                <p>A <b>Unicode Technical Standard (UTS)</b> is an independent 
                specification. Conformance to the Unicode Standard does not 
                imply conformance to any UTS.</p>
                <p>A <b>Unicode Technical Report (UTR)</b> contains informative 
                material. Conformance to the Unicode Standard does not imply 
                conformance to any UTR. Other specifications, however, are free 
                to make normative references to a UTR.</p>
               </blockquote>
                <p>As technical reports, including UAXes and UTSes, are developed, the Unicode Technical   
                Committee approves the posting of proposed updates or preliminary versions for   
                public review. Publication of these draft versions <i>does not</i>   
                imply endorsement by the Unicode Consortium.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>A <b>Proposed Update</b> of a UAX, UTS, or UTR 
                  contains the draft of a proposed modification of an already published 
                  UAX, UTS, or UTR.</p>
                   <p>A <b>Draft Unicode Technical Report (DUTR)</b> 
                  has the basic structure and content required for a new technical report, but has not
                  yet received final approval for publication.</p> 
                  <p>A <b>Proposed Draft Unicode Technical Report (PDUTR)</b> 
                  is in an early stage of development.</p> 
               </blockquote>
                <p>Any technical report that has
                <i>Proposed Update, Draft,</i> or <i>Proposed Draft,</i>
                status is a preliminary document which may be updated,  
                replaced, or superseded by other documents at any time. <i>Such 
                documents are not stable specifications; it is inappropriate to cite them  
                as other than works in progress.</i> Their status is always clearly
                indicated in the document.</p>

                <h2><a name="Development">Development</a> Process</h2>

                <p>Technical reports are created by the Unicode Consortium Technical
				Committees (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/utc.html">UTC</a>, 
				<a href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/process.html">CLDR-TC</a>, and
        <a href="http://uli.unicode.org/home/uli-process">ULI-TC</a>) following open,
				consensus-oriented processes. 
				For more information about the approval process,   
                see the FAQ on the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/faq/reports_process.html">Technical   
                Reports Development Process</a>. When 
                appropriate, the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/review/">Public 
                Review Issues</a> page solicits review and feedback on initial drafts for or updates 
                to technical reports.</p>
				<p><a href="tr10/index.html">UTS #10, Unicode Collation Algorithm</a>, has
				an additional set of policies governing the maintenance
				of the basic data table used in assigning collation weights
				to characters. See

        <h2><a name="Versioning">Versioning</a></h2>

        <!-- Ken Whistler new content starts here -->

        <p>Each technical report has a unique and persistent <b>report number</b> that is part of its title.
          For example, in UTS <b>#10</b>, Unicode Collation Algorithm, the "10" permanently
          identifies that specification, and never changes as the document
          is updated. Each technical report also has a
          <b>revision number</b>, which is then used to track and identify
          each proposed update and each approved publication of the document. 
          UAXes and UTSes have a separate <b>version number</b>, in addition to their revision number.
          The details of the meaning and assignment of version numbers for
          those types of technical reports are specified below.</p>

        <p>For information about citing versions of technical 
                reports, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/standard/versions/">Versions  
                of the Unicode Standard</a>.</p>

          <h3>Revision Numbering</h3>

                <p>Uniform and persistent revision numbers are used  
                for all technical reports.  
                This revision number is incremented and a new URL reflecting that
                revision number is provided  
                each time the file content is altered materially. Modifications to the 
                report are summarized in the change history section of each document.</p>

                <p>Revision numbers are reflected directly in the permanent, versioned
                  file names used in the URL for the document. Thus,
                  Revision 30 of UTS #10 is named .../reports/tr10/tr10-30.html, while
                  the earlier Revision 28 of the same technical report is named
                  .../reports/tr10/tr10-28.html, and so on. There were some departures
                  from this scheme for very early publications, but this naming convention
                  is now followed for all technical reports.</p>

                <p>Because revision numbers use whole 
                      numbers, rather than a major.minor.update version syntax, 
                      some technical reports have large revision numbers. Many 
                      of the revision number changes, however, reflect 
                      minor editorial changes to the documents, as 
        opposed to substantive changes to their contents.</p>

                <p>Minor
                  editorial corrections such as fixing a broken link may be made without
                  assigning a new revision number. In such 
                cases the date in the report header will, however, be updated, to
                indicate that a micro-edit has occurred.</p>

                <h3>Revision Back Link Trail</h3>

                <p> Each technical report has links to the  
                previous approved revision of the report and to the latest  
                approved revision of the report, allowing readers to find and  
                cite a particular revision. The back links to previous approved
                revisions can be followed all the way back to the initial
                drafts of the documents, if so desired, allowing examination
                of the complete history of the specification.</p>
                <p>Proposed update revisions of documents are not included
                in the back link trail of previous approved revisions, but
                any specific proposed update can still be accessed on
                the Unicode website by using the relevant revision number
                of that proposed update in the URL for the document.</p>

                <h3>Version Numbers for UAXes</h3>
                  <p>Because each UAX is formally a part of version of the Unicode
                    Standard, it is given a version number in addition to its
                    revision number. The version number always matches the
                    version of the Unicode Standard that it constitutes a part
                    of, and the version number reflects the
                    same major.minor.update format of the Unicode Standard.
                    For details regarding how major.minor.update versioning is
                    used for the Unicode Standard, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/index.html">
                    About Versions of the Unicode Standard</a>.</p> 
                <h3>Version Numbers for UTSes</h3>
                  <p>UTSes also have a version number in addition to their
                    revision number, but the conventions for assignment of
                    version numbers for UTSes differ somewhat from UAXes.</p>
                  <p>In some cases UTSes use major.minor format version numbers to distinguish 
                    minor updates of the documents from major changes in the 
                    specification. Such version numbers apply only to the UTS
                    in question and are not synchronized with versions of
                    the Unicode Standard.</p>
                    <p>In other cases a UTS may have associated data which is maintained
                    in synchrony with repertoire additions to the Unicode Standard.
                    In those cases, the UTS may be given a major.minor.update
                    version number which matches the version of the Unicode Standard
                    reflected in the data files.</p>
                  <p>Over time, a particular UTS may change its maintenance status,
                    and change from development that is not synchronized with releases
                    of the Unicode Standard to development which is synchronized
                    with those releases. When this happens, the version numbering
                    scheme for the specification changes as well. For example,
                    UTS #39, Unicode Security Mechanisms, was first published
                    as Version 2, then Version 3, but changed to Version 6.3.0
                    when its maintenance mode changed to synchronize with the
                    Unicode Standard, Version 6.3.0.</p> 

        <h2><a name="Data">Data Files for Technical Reports</a></h2>

        <p>Data files associated with UAXes are formally a part of the
          <a href="http://www.unicode.org/ucd/">Unicode Character Database</a> (UCD), 
          an integral part of each version of
          the Unicode Standard. Such data files are updated for each release
          of the Unicode Standard. Often there are no substantive
          changes required for particular data files, but the versions are bumped
          and new files are published, so that implementers have
          a complete set of data for each release.</p>

        <p>Some UTSes are also associated with data files. If the UTS is
          maintained in synchrony with the Unicode Standard, then its data
          files are also updated with each release, and the naming conventions
          for the UTS data directories also reflect the version numbering.
          However, such data files are not formally a part of the Unicode
          Character Database.</p>

        <p>UTRs may also have associated data files. In such cases, because
          a UTR has no version number distinct from its revision number,
          the associated data files are published in a data directory which
          reflects the revision number. A new revision data directory is
          created each time the UTR itself is updated, but such revisions are
          not synchronized with releases of the Unicode Standard.</p>

        <p>Data files for UTSes or UTRs are 
          maintained in separate folders under <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/">
            http://www.unicode.org/Public/</a>. The location of each set of 
          data files is documented in the corresponding UTS or UTR. Each folder 
          contains a complete set of data files for that version of the 
          document.</p>

        <!-- Ken Whistler new content ends here -->

                <h2><a name="Stable">Stable References to Sections of Technical Reports</a></h2>

<p>The UAXes, UTSes, and some of the UTRs have stable HTML anchors defined for section headers. These enable direct links to those sections. More recent versions of technical reports have stable HTML anchors for tables, figures, each formal rule or definition, and the modification history of the document. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>link to a section in UAX #44: <a href="tr44/index.html#Matching_Rules">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Matching_Rules</a></li>
  <li>link to a rule in UAX #9: <a href="tr9/index.html#X2">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#X2</a></li>
  <li>link to a table in UAX #44: <a href="tr44/index.html#Property_List_Table">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Property_List_Table</a></li>
  <li>link to the modification history in UAX #29: <a href="tr29.1#Modifications">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Modifications</a></li></ul>

                <h2><a name="Withdrawn">Superseded or Withdrawn Reports</a></h2>

                <p>Occasionally, the material of a report is incorporated into another document, for
                example <a href="tr13/tr13-9.html">UAX #13 Newline Guidelines</a> became Section 5.8, <i>Newline Guidelines</i> 
                in the Core Specification of the Unicode Standard as of Version 4.0. 
				Such reports are considered <i>superseded </i>and are listed in their own

                <p>Instead of a link to

                has a link to a page explaining the change in status (<a href="tr13.1">Example</a>). 
				Where applicable, that page also provides information on where the material was incorporated. 
				A similar page is provided for reports 
                which have been formally withdrawn. The numbers of superseded or 
                withdrawn reports are never reused.</p>

                <h2><a name="OldVersions">Old Versions of the Unicode Standard</a></h2>

				<p>Prior to 2003, several minor versions of the Unicode Standard were
				published as Unicode Technical 
				Reports or as Unicode Standard Annexes. Such reports are listed in their own
				<a href="http://unicode.org/reports/#oldversions">section</a> on 
				the <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/">Technical Reports</a> page. Instead of a direct link to the last approved document for those minor
				versions, the reports page has a link to a page providing a summary for 
				that version of the Unicode Standard. 
        (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode3.1.0/">Example</a>)</p>
