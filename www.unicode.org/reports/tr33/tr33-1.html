	<h2><a name="Overview">1<span> </span>Overview</a> </h2>
	<p>The Unicode Standard [<a href="tr33-1.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] is a very large and 
	complex standard. Because of this, and because of the nature and role of the 
	standard, it is often rather difficult to determine, in any particular case, 
	just exactly what conformance to the Unicode Standard means. </p>
	<p>The Unicode Standard forms the foundation 
	which supports a large variety of operations on textual data, from data interchange 
	protocols to complex tasks like sorting, rendering or content analysis. All of these 
	processes expose 
	implementations to the complexities of human languages and writing systems.
	</p>
	<p>Earlier character sets were either small, or had a clearly limited field 
	of application, (such as by geographical area), or both. By contrast, the Unicode Standard 
	aims to be universal. A universal character encoding standard cannot rely on implicit agreements about the nature 
	and behavior of the characters it encodes, it must provide explicit constraints 
	on their identity and intended use. At the same time, the standard must allow 
	implementations the necessary flexibility to address the expectations of 
	its users, while providing enough constraints to guarantee predictable interchange 
	of data and consistency between implementations.</p>
	<p>This Conformance Model explains the issue of conformance relating to the 
	Unicode Standard so that users better understand the contexts in which products 
	are making claims for support of the Unicode Standard, and implementers better 
	understand how to meet the formal conformance requirements while satisfying 
	the expectations of their users. It does not alter, augment or override the 
	actual Unicode conformance requirements found in the text of the Unicode Standard. 
	Rather it attempts to provide a conceptual framework to make it easier for users 
	and implementers to identify and understand the specific conformance requirements 
	contained in [<a href="tr33-1.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
	<p>This model defines conformance terminology, specifies different areas and 
	levels of conformance, and describes what it means to make a claim of conformance 
	or &quot;support&quot; of the standard. This model is not a framework for 
	conformance verification testing, 
	although it could be used to develop such a framework, should that prove desirable. 
	At this time no such framework has been developed by the Unicode Consortium, 
	nor have any conformance verification tests been required or sanctioned.</p>
	<p>Many of the concepts presented here are equally applicable to other standards 
	developed by the Unicode Consortium, such as the
	<a href="../tr10/index.html">Unicode Collation Algorithm</a> 
	[<a href="tr33-1.html#UCA">UCA</a>], and the specifications for Unicode support in regular 
	expressions [<a href="tr33-1.html#RegEx">RegEx</a>].</p>
	<h2><a name="Terminology">2 Terminology</a></h2>
	<p>This section gives a basic introduction to the terminology that will be discussed 
	in more detail in sections below.</p>
	<h3>2.1 <a name="Conformance">Conformance</a></h3>
	<p>In the context of formal standards, <i>conformance</i> refers to a set of 
	rules or criteria whereby a relevant entity such as an element of information 
	interchange, a device, an application, or a piece of hardware, can be evaluated 
	as either meeting or not meeting the specification in the standard. In general, 
	a formal standard will have a conformance clause or clauses, which will be stated 
	in terms of conditionals, such as &quot;X is in conformance with Y specification 
	of this standard if Z&quot;, or modals, often in uppercase, such as &quot;An X that conforms 
	with Y specification of this standard SHALL Z&quot;. The modal verbs that standards 
	language commonly associates with such statements are often carefully defined 
	to avoid any ambiguities in interpretation. In common practice, they involve 
	specialized usage of &quot;SHALL&quot; and &quot;MUST&quot; for requirements, but also &quot;MAY&quot; for 
	permitted deviations and &quot;SHOULD&quot; for non-binding recommendations. </p>
	<p>If a standard is complex, the conformance clause or clauses themselves may 
	also be complex. Occasionally, a conformance clause may simply be stated along 
	the lines of &quot;X is in conformance with this standard if it follows the specification 
	in section W&quot; where section W may consist of hundreds of pages and constitute 
	most of the rest of the standard.</p>
	<h3>2.2 <a name="Compliance">Compliance</a></h3>
	<p>The term <i>compliance</i> is often used synonymously with the term conformance 
	and will be used that way in this model. </p>
	<h3>2.3 <a name="Normative">Normative</a> and Informative</h3>
	<p>Formal standards often distinguish between <i>normative</i> and <i>informative</i> 
	content. This distinction may be highly conventionalized, or even subject to 
	rules specified in other standards, such as for ISO standards, or the distinction 
	may be less formally maintained.</p>
	<p>Normative content of a standard is content which is required for all of the 
	conformance requirements to be meaningful. Typically a standard will have normative 
	definitions for terms used in the rest of the specification,&nbsp; normative 
	references to other standards or sources whose content is referred to indirectly, 
	and normative clauses, specifications, or sections, which actually define the 
	content of the standard to which the conformance clauses apply.</p>
	<p>Informative content of a standard is all material which has been added for 
	clarification, but which, in the judgment of the standard&#39;s maintainers, could 
	in principle be omitted without materially affecting the specification to which 
	the conformance clauses refer. If a standard is changed over time, the status 
	of some particular content could change from informative to normative, or vice 
	versa, depending on whether it became required for conformance or was no longer 
	required for conformance.</p>
	<h3>2.4 Conformance <a name="Verification">Verification</a></h3>
	<p>In the context of the Unicode Conformance Model, <i>conformance verification</i> 
	means an external (third party) determination that under some specified set 
	of circumstances an entity meets one or more requirements of the conformance 
	clauses of the standard. In other words, while conformance clauses are 
	merely a logical statement of requirements, conformance verification 
	implies the existence of conformance verification tests, that have been applied to entities 
	in order to make such determinations. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>A conformance claim can simply be stated. It is an assertion that entity 
		X meets a requirement of the standard. </li>
		<li>A verification of a conformance claim, on the other hand, is the result 
		of the specific application of a test designed to determine the validity 
		of a conformance claim. Such tests are called conformance verification tests.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Unicode Consortium does not endorse a particular methodology for 
	conformance verification.</p>
	<h3>2.5 Conformance <a name="Testing">Testing</a></h3>
	<p>A standard may include tests or &quot;benchmarks&quot; as part of the text of the standard, 
	or as external documents associated with the standard. While there is some overlap 
	in general usage of the terms &quot;conformance test&quot; and &quot;conformance verification 
	tests&quot;, a systematic distinction is drawn between the two in the Unicode Conformance 
	Model. </p>
	<h4>2.5.1 Conformance Tests</h4>
	<p>A <i>conformance test</i> for the Unicode Standard is a list of data certified by 
	the Unicode Technical Committee [<a href="tr33-1.html#UTC">UTC</a>] to be &quot;correct&quot; with regard to some particular 
	requirement for conformance to the standard. In some instances, as for example, 
	the implementation of the bidirectional algorithm, producing a definitive list 
	of correct results is difficult or impossible, and in such cases, a conformance 
	test may consist of an implemented algorithm certified by the UTC to produce 
	correct results for any pertinent input data. Conformance tests for the Unicode 
	Standard are essentially benchmarks that someone can use to determine if their 
	algorithm, API, etc., claiming to conform to some requirement of the standard, 
	does in fact match the data that the UTC asserts define such conformance.
	</p>
	<h4>2.5.2 Conformance Verification Tests</h4>
	<p>A <i>conformance verification test</i> for the Unicode Standard is a test, usually designed and implemented by a third party not associated 
	with the Unicode Consortium or the UTC, intended to test a product which claims 
	conformance to one or more aspects of the Unicode Standard, for actual conformance 
	to the standard. Thus a conformance verification test is a <i>test of a product</i>. 
	Such a test, may, of course, make use of one or more of the Unicode conformance 
	tests to determine the results of its conformance verification. </p>
	<h3>2.6 <a name="Support">Support</a> </h3>
	<p>In the context of the Unicode Conformance Model, the term <i>support</i> 
	refers to a more generalized claim of intent to conform to one or another requirement 
	of the standard. A claim of Unicode support may in fact be difficult to verify, 
	because it can be vague in detail. However, at least it indicates in principle 
	that the developer or user of an entity intends conformance. More specifically, 
	support often refers to a claim of particular repertoire coverage. For example, 
	an application may claim support for Unicode Greek. That should be interpreted 
	as meaning that Unicode Greek characters will be handled in conformance with 
	the standard, and that all other relevant aspects of processing of those characters 
	with which that particular application is concerned, will be done in such a 
	way as not to violate the conformance clauses of the standard.</p>
	<h3>2.7 <a name="Versioning">Versioning</a> </h3>
	<p>The Unicode Standard is regularly versioned, as new characters are added. 
	A formal system of versioning is in place, involving three levels of versions:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>major versions</li>
		<li>minor versions</li>
		<li>update versions</li>
	</ol>
	<p>All three levels have carefully controlled rules for the type of documentation 
	required, handling of the associated data files, and allowable types of change 
	between versions. For more information about Unicode versioning see [<a href="tr33-1.html#Versions">Versions</a>]. 
	Other standards developed by the Unicode Consortium may use a single level versioning 
	scheme.</p>
	<p>Conformance claims clearly must be specific to versions of the Unicode 
	Standard, but the level of specificity needed for a claim may vary according 
	to the nature of the particular conformance claim being made.&nbsp; Some 
	standards developed by the Unicode Consortium require separate conformance 
	to a specific version (or later), of the Unicode Standard. This version is 
	sometimes called the <i>base version</i>. In such cases, the version of the standard and 
	the version of the Unicode standard to which the conformance claim refers must 
	be compatible.</p>
	<h3>2.8 <a name="Corrigenda">Corrigenda</a> and Errata</h3>
	<p>If a technical deficiency in the specifications of the Unicode Standard is 
	identified, it may be corrected by a change in the next version, or, if sufficiently 
	important, by a formal corrigendum. A corrigendum often applies to several earlier 
	versions, but does not retroactively change them. Implementations can claim conformance to any of these versions with 
	the given corrigendum applied. For more on corrigenda see [<a href="tr33-1.html#Versions">Versions</a>].</p>
	<p>This approach to corrigenda differs from the approach in other standards 
	organizations, such as ISO.</p>
	<p>Errata are used to describe other known defects in the text. Unlike corrigenda 
	they cannot be referenced in a conformance claim. For more information on errata 
	see [<a href="tr33-1.html#Errata">Errata</a>].</p>
	<h3>2.9 <a name="Stability">Stability</a> and Invariance </h3>
	<p>Each version of the Unicode 
	Standard, once published, is absolutely stable and will never change. 
	Implementations or specifications that refer to a specific version of the 
	Unicode Standard can rely upon this stability. If future versions of these 
	implementations or specifications upgrade to a future version of the Unicode 
	Standard, then some changes may be necessary.</p>
	<p>Some formal standards are developed once and then are essentially frozen 
	and stable forever. For such standards, stability of content and the corresponding 
	stability of conformance claims is not an issue. </p>
	<p>For a standard aimed at the universal encoding of characters, such stability is not possible. The standard is 
	necessarily evolving and expanding over time, to extend its coverage to 
	include all 
	the writing systems of the world. And as experience in its implementation accumulates, 
	further aspects of character processing are added to the formal content of the 
	standard. This fundamentally dynamic quality of the Unicode Standard complicates 
	issues of conformance, because of the continually expanding content to which 
	conformance requirements pertain. This expansion is both an expansion in breadth 
	by adding more characters, and scripts, and in depth by adding more aspects 
	of character processing. </p>
	<p>Invariance refers to those aspects of the content of the Unicode Standard 
	that have been formally defined as unchangeable, even as the standard continues 
	its development.&nbsp; The guarantee of the stability of the formal 
	Unicode character names is a fairly trivial example. While in principle such 
	names <i>could</i> be changed, and were changed once between Version 1.0 and Version 1.1, the [<a href="tr33-1.html#UTC">UTC</a>] 
	has determined that such changes are too disruptive and have too little benefit 
	to be tolerated. Accordingly, the stability of character names has been promoted 
	to the status of an invariant in the standard.</p>
	<p>A further discussion of invariance and invariants can be found in [<a href="tr33-1.html#PropertyModel">PropertyModel</a>]. 
	Invariants guard against change for the sake of change, or technological drift, 
	but they also prevent the correction of clerical errors, which is not a negligible 
	issue in a standard as large and complex as the Unicode Standard. For a current 
	list of invariants and a discussion of the tradeoffs, see the
	<a href="http://www.unicode.org/standard/stability_policy.html">Unicode Stability 
	Policy for Character Encoding and Character Properties </a>[<a href="tr33-1.html#Stability">Stability</a>].</p>
	<p>Conformance claims need to be distinguished in terms of their relationship 
	to invariants and non-invariants in the standard because of their different 
	risk levels for stability. </p>
	<h2>3 <a name="Structure">Structure of Unicode Conformance</a> </h2>
	<p>This section will serve as a guide to the particular way that the Unicode 
	Standard expresses conformance requirements, both in terms of where they are 
	located and how they are expressed. It also explores the peculiar aspects of 
	conformance related to the synchronized status of the Unicode Standard and the 
	independent but closely aligned International Standard ISO/IEC 10646, which 
	has its own conformance clauses expressed using ISO conventions. </p>
	<h3><a name="Definitions">3.1 Definitions</a></h3>
	<p>Chapter 3, &quot;Conformance&quot; of [<a href="tr33-1.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] contains formal 
	definitions of terms referenced in the conformance clauses. While modifications 
	of these definitions between versions of the Unicode Standard have been, and 
	will continue to be necessary, every effort is made to keep the numbering of 
	the definitions stable. This makes it easier to maintain external specifications 
	that cite a particular definition.</p>
	<h3><a name="Clauses">3.2 Conformance Clauses</a></h3>
	<p>The conformance clauses in Section 3.2, &quot;Conformance Requirements&quot; of [<a href="tr33-1.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] 
	define the requirements for a conformant implementation. They are expressed 
	in terms of the definitions, but also refer to additional specifications contained 
	in Unicode Standard Annexes. While modifications of these clauses between versions 
	of the Unicode Standard have been, and will continue to be necessary, every 
	effort is made to keep the numbering of the clauses stable. This makes it easier 
	to maintain external specifications that cite a particular clause.</p>
	<h3><a name="Annexes">3.3 Unicode Standard Annexes</a></h3>
	<p>A Unicode Standard Annex (UAX) contains part of the standard, published as 
	a standalone document. The relation between conformance to the Unicode Standard 
	and conformance to each of the Unicode Standard Annexes is spelled out in detail 
	in Section 3.2, &quot;Conformance Requirements&quot; of [<a href="tr33-1.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]. Some of the 
	conformance clauses refer explicitly to specifications contained in UAXs, such 
	as the <a href="../tr9/index.html">Bidirectional Algorithm</a> 
	[<a href="tr33-1.html#Bidi">Bidi</a>] or <a href="../tr15.1">
	Normalization Forms</a> [<a href="tr33-1.html#Normalization">Normalization</a>]. Normative 
	material in other UAXs is defined by any of the mechanisms described below.</p>
	<p>Other standards developed by the 
	Unicode Consortium have their own conformance model.</p>
	<h3><a name="Identification">3.4 Identification of Normative Content </a>
	</h3>
	<p><font color="#FF0000"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">[Text for 3.4 
	TBD]</span></font></p>
	<h3><a name="Properties">3.5 Properties</a></h3>
	<p><font color="#FF0000"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">[Ed. Note: 
	Mention that UCD.html defines which are normative properties. See also property model.]</span></font></p>
	<h3><a name="Algorithms">3.6 Algorithms</a></h3>
	<p>Unicode algorithms are specified as a series of logical steps. In many cases, 
	the input to the algorithm is a string of character properties: in other words, 
	the results of the algorithm are identical for different input strings, as long 
	as each input string maps to the same string of character property values. Conformance 
	to a Unicode algorithm does not require repeating the steps as described, but 
	rather requires achieving the same outputs for the same inputs. This provides 
	the necessary flexibility for implementations to pursue optimizations. Whether 
	or not conformance to a given algorithm is required by Unicode conformance, 
	implementations claiming to implement one of these algorithms must do so in 
	conformance with its specification.</p>
	<h3><a name="Tailoring">3.7 Tailoring</a></h3>
	<p>Some algorithms provide explicit methods for tailoring, or customizing a 
	general algorithm to the needs of a specific language, locality or application. 
	Other algorithms simply describe the best default practice, and customization 
	is assumed for any practical application. An example of this is the line breaking 
	algorithm in [<a href="tr33-1.html#LineBreak">LineBreak</a>]. Whether or not conformance 
	to a given algorithm is required by Unicode Conformance, implementations claiming 
	to implement one of these algorithms must disclose the use of tailoring or 
	customization.</p>
	<h3><a name="Relation">3.8 Relation to 10646 Conformance</a></h3>
	<p>The Unicode Standard and ISO/IEC 10646 share the same repertoire of coded 
	characters, including the character code position, character name and 
	identity. However, the two standards differ in the precise terms of their 
	conformance specifications. Any conformant Unicode implementation will 
	conform to ISO/IEC 10646, but because the Unicode Standard imposes 
	additional constraints on character semantics and transmittability, not all 
	implementations that are compliant with ISO/IEC 10646 will be compliant with 
	the Unicode Standard. For a detailed description see Appendix C, &quot;Relationship to ISO/IEC 10646&quot; 
	of [<a href="tr33-1.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
	<h2>4 <a name="Areas">Areas of Conformance</a></h2>
	<p>There are several broad areas of application where Unicode Conformance makes 
	specific types of requirements. Because not all applications and implementations 
	cover all these areas, some aspects of Unicode conformance may not be applicable 
	to them.</p>
	<p><span class="changedspan">Unicode Technical Report #32: <i>Assessing 
	Unicode Support</i> [<a href="tr33-1.html#UTR32">UTR32</a>] discusses ways to assess 
	the support for the Unicode standard in several common implementation areas.</span></p>
	<h3>4.1 <a name="Representation">Representation</a> </h3>
	<p>Representation covers all aspects of being able to express and transmit Unicode 
	data. It is a requirement applicable to certain protocols (for example, XML), 
	but might apply to the storage aspects of databases and other file formats as 
	well. Conformant representation applies to correct use of encoding forms and 
	encoding schemes, as well as the ability to represent all Unicode code points. 
	In addition, issues related to [<a href="tr33-1.html#Normalization">Normalization</a>] 
	are important. </p>
	<h3>4.2 <a name="Transcoding">Transcoding</a></h3>
	<p>Conformant transcoding between Unicode and all other, so-called <i>legacy
	</i>character encodings, retains the identity of the transcoded characters. 
	In addition, it may claim to retain a specific normalization form for the 
	converted data. See [<a href="tr33-1.html#Normalization">Normalization</a>]. [<a href="tr33-1.html#CharMapML">CharMapML</a>] 
	defines a format for expressing character mappings. Implementations may 
	choose to conform to that format in order to be able to interchange mapping 
	tables.</p>
	<h3>4.3 String <a name="Processing">Processing</a> </h3>
	<p>String processing covers all operations on Unicode texts that can be carried 
	out without considering layout and specifically without considering fonts. String 
	processing encompasses a large variety of operations including, but not limited 
	to text segmentation, text parsing, handling regular expressions, searching, 
	and sorting, as well as creating formatted text representation of data types. For 
	a number of these operations model algorithms and other specifications exist 
	to which an implementation may claim conformance, such as [<a href="tr33-1.html#UCA">UCA</a>]. 
	[<a href="tr33-1.html#RegEx">RegEx</a>], [<a href="tr33-1.html#Boundaries">Boundaries</a>], [<a href="tr33-1.html#LineBreak">LineBreak</a>].</p>
	<h3>4.4 Text <a name="Layout">Layout</a>, including Display and Selection</h3>
	<p>Layout comprises all operations that go from backing store to displayed text. 
	The same operations are run in reverse for selection. These operations are dependent on font data, 
	but are considered separately from fonts because the same implementation typically can 
	work with a range of different fonts. Some operations, such as suppressing 
	the display of certain ignorable code points are typically handled by the 
	layout system without involving fonts. Conformance issues for layout 
	processes include reordering from logical to display ordering, as well as 
	positional shape selection. For bidirectional reordering, conformance to 
	[<a href="tr33-1.html#Bidi">Bidi</a>] is required. For positional shaping and script-specific layout, model 
	algorithms exist, or are being developed for Arabic and Syriac, Devanagari, 
	Tamil and other Indic Scripts, as well as Mongolian. While the requirements 
	of high end typography typically exceed these script-specific 
	specifications, conformance requires a relation between specific constructs 
	in the writing system and corresponding character code sequences, so that 
	these constructs can be interchanged reliably.</p>
	<p>[Ed. note. Add example, e.g. use of ZW(N)J in Indic scripts. (expressing 
	linguistic constructs).]</p>
	<h3>4.5 <a name="Fonts">Fonts</a> </h3>
	<p>The Unicode Standard does not standardize the actual appearance of characters, 
	but instead intends that they should be depicted within a customary range of 
	design interpretations. Conformance to the Unicode Standard therefore primarily refers 
	to those tables in the fonts that correlate character codes with the glyphs 
	in the font, for example &#39;cmap&#39; tables, and to claims of &quot;coverage&quot; of 
	the Unicode 
	repertoire by fonts. </p>
	<h3>4.6 <a name="Input">Input</a></h3>
	<p>Conformance-related issues for character input consists of coverage of Unicode repertoire, conversion of input to Unicode 
	character values for storage, and consistency with the text models required 
	for particular scripts and text layout. The entities here are mostly IME&#39;s and 
	keyboards (drivers). </p>
	<h2><a name="Levels">5 Levels of Conformance</a></h2>
	<p>Unicode Technical Standard #18, 
	Unicode Regular Expression [<a href="tr33-1.html#RegEx">RegEx</a>] is an example of a standard that has well defined 
	levels of conformance. Each implementation can claim conformance to a 
	specific level, and each level makes specific conformance requirements. By 
	contrast, conformance to the Unicode standard is not organized into such 
	discrete levels. However, there are some areas where the standard allows 
	limited, or partial support of some requirements.</p>
	<h3>5.1 <a name="Repertoire_Coverage">Repertoire Coverage</a></h3>
	<p>The Unicode standard explicitly 
	does not require that all implementations support all Unicode characters. 
	Any implementation may support an arbitrary subset of Unicode characters, 
	and in fact, may support different sets of characters for different 
	operations.</p>
	<p>However, for certain algorithms, any implementation that claims 
	conformance is required to support the full range of Unicode code points 
	covered by that algorithm. For example, an implementation of normalization, or&nbsp; 
	a UTF-8 converter is required to support the entire 
	range of Unicode code points.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><b>Note:</b> an 
		implementation may define an algorithm, such as identifier matching, 
		that uses normalization as part of the algorithm but also restricts the 
		allowable set of input characters. In that case, any implementation of 
		that algorithm is free to use a limited implementation of normalization, 
		because the limit on the input makes it impossible to distinguish 
		between a full and limited implementation of normalization.</p>

	<h3>5.2 <a name="Full_Conformance">Full Conformance</a> </h3>
	<p>This and the next section consider conformance separately for each of the 
	major areas of Section 4. Full conformance in a given area is not 
	necessarily the same as full support for that area, as conformance 
	requirements in many cases are minimal requirements. Exceptions are certain 
	well-defined areas such as encoding forms or normalization that have few or no options 
	and few or no levels.</p>
	<h3>5.3 <a name="Partial_Conformance">Partial Conformance</a> - Levels of Support Defined </h3>
	<p>This section will provide both a typology for levels of conformance in an 
	area, by presenting an alternative to the notion that all aspects of Unicode conformance are either/or 
	issues together with specific lists of levels of conformance and support where they 
	can be pulled out of the standard.</p>
	<p><font color="#FF0000"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">[Ed.: For example, the standard explicitly talks 
	about levels of surrogate support, which is an example that should be abstracted, along with others, 
	to provide the basis for determining how to make various claims of conformance.]</span></font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF0000"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">[Ed. This section could describe best practices of deciding levels of conformance 
	or it could describe how conformance requirements relate to best practices in 
	a given area.]</span></font></p>

	<p><font color="#FF3333"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">[ The following 
	content is just sketched out in outline form.&nbsp; Could also cover what 
	should be tagged with a Unicode version and when.]</span></font></p>
	<h3>6.1 <a name="Inter-level">Inter-level</a> Compatibility Issues</h3>
	<p>Conformant implementations will have to interact with both down-level and 
	up-level implementations. This creates particular issues. The Unicode conformance 
	requirements are structured to encourage implementations to passively support 
	data containing characters assigned in future versions of the standard.</p>
	<h4>6.1.1 Down-level Compatibility</h4>
	<p><font color="#FF0000"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">[Ed. Note: 
	Describe any additional strategies the standard follows. What are implementation 
	strategies?]</span></font></p>
	<p>For several important properties, [Unicode] 
	provides explicit support for implementations that need to be compatible 
	with a down-level version of the relevant algorithm. This is usually done by 
	guaranteeing the stability of property assignments [<a href="tr33-1.html#Stability">Stability</a>]. 
	In some cases, specific properties are introduced that isolate an algorithm 
	from changes in a character&#39;s General Category. For an example, see the 
	section on backwards compatibility in UAX#31:
	<i>Identifier and Pattern Syntax</i> [<a href="tr33-1.html#Identifier">Identifier</a>].</p>
	<h4>6.1.2 Up-level Compatibility</h4>
	<p><font color="#FF0000"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">[Ed. Note: 
	Describe any additional strategies the standard follows. Are there other implementation 
	strategies?]</span></font></p>
	<p>For most properties, there is a single default value that down-level 
	systems can apply to unassigned characters when present in data sent from 
	up-level systems. Where the fallback represented by such default value would 
	give particularly poor results, the [<a href="tr33-1.html#UCD">UCD</a>] or [<a href="tr33-1.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] 
	provide for several ranges with different default values. Such default 
	values increase the chance that an actual property assigned to a new 
	character will be the same as the default value for its code point in the 
	down-level version of [Unicode].&nbsp; An example are the [<a href="tr33-1.html#Bidi">Bidi</a>] 
	properties, which default to strong right-to-left for areas of the code 
	space earmarked for RTL scripts.</p>
	<p>A common implementation technique is to use dynamic assignment of 
	implementation specific default values, based on the actual property values 
	of characters surrounding an unassigned code point. Such interpolation of 
	character properties can further increase the chance that any given code 
	point is treated compatibly by a down-level system.</p>
	<h3>6.2 Repertoire <a name="Repertoire_Matching">Matching</a></h3>
	<p>It is generally not helpful to tag data created by an implementation with 
	the version level of Unicode supported by that implementation. Because 
	the repertoire of that version of Unicode is far larger than the actual set 
	of characters used in the data, a large part of text data created and 
	interchanged worldwide can be represented in <i>all</i> versions of Unicode. 
	Therefore, the version level of the implementation bears little relation to 
	the repertoire needed to cover the data. </p>
	<p>Most implementations will not equally support the entire repertoire of Unicode 
	characters for a given version. In fact, there is no conformance requirement 
	to support any specific part of the repertoire. Therefore, even if the version 
	level of a receiving implementation is higher than that of the creating implementation 
	there is no guarantee that both support the repertoire covered by the data, 
	or support it equally well.</p>
	<p>[<a href="tr33-1.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] defines no method for enumerating or identifying common sub-repertoires 
	of the standard, but ISO/IEC 10646 does so. Implementations can use the [<a href="tr33-1.html#DerivedAge">DerivedAge</a>] 
	for each character code to avoid sending character codes to a down-level 
	system which lacks a definition for them. Because character coding is strictly additive, 
	implementations 
	receiving data can easily identify characters that are not defined in the version 
	of the standard to which they conform and take appropriate action. In many cases, 
	appropriate action consists of passing through such data, or treating them as 
	characters possessing default properties. (See UTR#23: <i>
	<a href="../tr23.1">Unicode Character 
	Property Model </a>&nbsp;</i>[<a href="tr33-1.html#PropertyModel">PropertyModel</a>] for more details on default properties).</p>
	<p><font color="#FF0000"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">[Ed. note: 
	Additional input on differentiating implementations into input andoutput, 
	extending the repertoire from characters to sequences. Definde the 
	responsibility of people assembling systems from systems conformance of the 
	whole form conf of the parts..]</span></font></p>
	<h3>6.3 <a name="Matching_Areas">Matching Areas</a> and Levels of Conformance between Implementations and 
	Components</h3>
	<p>A mere matching of version numbers between an implementation and components 
	it relies on will not be sufficient, because components may subset the repertoire 
	they support or choose a different level of conformance, where available.</p>
