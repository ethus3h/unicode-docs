  <h2>1 <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
  <p>The ability to seamlessly handle multiple character encodings is crucial in
  today's world, where a server may need to handle many different client
  character encodings covering many different markets. No matter how characters
  are represented, servers need to be able to process them appropriately.
  Unicode provides a common model and representation of characters for all the
  languages of the world. Because of this, Unicode is being adopted by more and
  more systems as the internal storage processing code. Rather than trying to
  maintain data in literally hundreds of different encodings, a program can
  translate the source data into Unicode on entry, process it as required, and
  translate it into a target character set on request.</p>
  <p>Even where Unicode is not used as a process code, it is often used as a <i>pivot</i>
  encoding. Data can be converted first to Unicode and then into the eventual
  target encoding. This requires only a hundred tables, rather than ten
  thousand.</p>
  <p>Whether or not Unicode is used, it is  vital to maintain the
  consistency of data across conversions between different character encodings.
  Because of the fluidity of data in a networked world, it is easy for it to be
  converted from, say, CP950 on a Windows platform, sent to a UNIX server as
  UTF-8, processed, and converted back to CP950 for representation on another
  client machine. This requires implementations to have identical mappings for a
  character encoding, no matter what platform they are working on. It also
  requires them to use the <i>same</i> name for the same encoding, and <i>different</i>
  names for different encodings. This is difficult to do unless there is a
  standard specification for the mappings so that it can be precisely determined
  what the encoding actually maps to.</p>
  <p>This technical report provides  a standard specification for the  
  interchange of mapping data for character encodings. By using this  
  specification, implementations on any platform can be assured of providing precisely the same mappings as all other implementations, 
  regardless of platform. The  
  use of CharMapML in and of itself does not guarantee that the result of a  
  mapping is in a Unicode Encoding Form.</p>  
  <p>The DTD does not specify valid documents. It is 
  insufficient for the specification of all of the constraints on CharMapML 
  files. The constraints are fully specified in this Unicode Technical Standard.</p>
  <h3>1.1 <a name="Illegal_and_Unassigned">Illegal and Unassigned Codes</a></h3>
  <p>When converting data between different character encodings, the conversion 
  software needs to distinguish the different types of errors that 
  can occur. These 
  fall into three main categories: sequences that are illegal, unassigned and 
  unmappable.</p>
  <p>There are two variants when the sequence is <i>illegal.</i> In the first
  variant, the sequence is <i>incomplete</i>. For example, </p>
      <ul>
        <li>0xA3 is incomplete in CP950. Unless followed by another byte of the right form, it is
              illegal.</li>
        <li>0xC2 is incomplete in UTF-8. Unless followed by another value of the right form, it is 
              illegal.</li>
        <li>0x80 is incomplete in UTF-8. Unless preceded by another value of the right form, it is 
              illegal.</li>
      </ul>
      The second variant is where the sequence is complete, but explicitly                    
      illegal. For example,                    
      <ul>
        <li>0xC0 is illegal in UTF-8. This value can never occur in valid UTF-8 
          text.</li>
      </ul>
  In the second category, the source sequence represents a valid code point, but is <i>unassigned</i>                    
      (also known as <i>undefined</i>). This sequence may be given an assignment in some                    
      future version of the character encoding.                    
      For example, 0xA3 0xBF is unassigned in CP950, as of 1999. 0x0EDE is unassigned in Unicode, V3.0<p>                    
  In the third category, the source sequence is assigned, but <i>unmappable:</i> there is no
      corresponding code point in the target encoding to accurately represent
      the source sequence.
      For example, the long dash is assigned in Unicode, but cannot be mapped to
          ISO-8859-1.</p>
  <p>In the case of illegal source sequences, a conversion routine will
  typically provide three options. It may stop with an error (or throw an exception).
  Secondly, it may skip the source sequence. While this is commonly an option, it can also hide corruption
          problems in the source text. Lastly, it may map to a substitution character such as the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (U+FFFD).</p>
  <p>When a conversion routine stops with an error, the routine should
  communicate the cause of the error and the length and contents of the bad
  sequence. It should be possible to resume the conversion after the
  caller handles the bad sequence.</p>
      <p>There is an important difference between the case where a
    sequence represents a real REPLACEMENT CHARACTER in a legacy encoding, as
    opposed to just being unassigned, and thereby mapped to REPLACEMENT
    CHARACTER (using an API substitution option). </p>
    <p>An API may choose to signal an illegal sequence in a legacy
    character set by mapping it to a <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#noncharacter">noncharacter</a> code
    point (Definition D7b in the Unicode Standard), such as U+FFFF. However, this
    mechanism runs the risk of these values being transmitted in Unicode text
    (which is thus non-conformant), and should be used with caution. </p>
  <p>Unassigned sequences can be handled with any of the above options, plus
  some additional ones. They should always be treated as a single code point:
  for example, 0xA3BF is treated as a single code point when mapping into
  Unicode from CP950. Especially because unassigned characters may actually come
  from a more recent version of the character encoding, it is often important to
  preserve round-trip mappings if possible. This can be done by mapping to private use space. Unicode (and some other character encodings) provide a large area
          of Private Use characters. These can be used to provide round-trip
          mappings for private use characters from other character encodings, as
          well as provisional mappings for characters that have not yet been
          encoded in Unicode. A second option is to represent unassigned
  sequences by hex escape sequences. For example, when mapping from U+1234 to other code pages, it can be
          represented by &quot;&amp;#x1234;&quot; in XML or HTML,
          &quot;\u1234&quot; in Java, C99 or C++, or &quot;\x{1234}&quot; in
          Perl.</p>
  <p>For unmappable sequences, an additional 
  option of mapping to a fallback character sequence may be available. In this case, an unmappable sequence is given a &quot;best fit&quot; 
          mapping. For example, an encoding might not have curly quotes; the 
          generic quotes could be used as a fallback; or if EM DASH is 
          unmappable, a sequence of two HYPHEN-MINUS characters could be used as 
          a fallback.</p> 
  <p>It is important that systems be able to distinguish between the 
  fallback mappings and regular mappings. Systems like XML allow the use of decimal or 
  hexadecimal escape sequences (Numeric Character References) to preserve round-trip integrity; use of fallback 
  characters in that case corrupts the data.</p> 
  <p>Because illegal sequences represent some corruption of the data stream,
  conversion routines may be directed to handle them differently than unassigned
  or unmappable sequences. For example, a routine might map an unassigned
  sequence
  to a substitution character, but throw an exception when it encounters an illegal
  sequence.</p>
  <h4>1.1.1 <a name="Best-Fit_Mappings">Best-Fit Mappings</a></h4>
  <p>In cases where a specified character mapping table is not available, a best-fit mapping table can be used.
  This
  technique should be used with caution because data can be corrupted.
  For example, in XML there are different strategies depending on whether the
  process is parsing or generating.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Suppose that there are two sets X and SUB_X, where X is a superset of
    SUB_X. (That is, every roundtrip mapping that is in SUB_X is also in X, and
    X may contain additional round-trip mappings.) Then:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is acceptable to parse with X when the file is tagged as SUB_X.
      Because X is
        a superset, all the characters will be read correctly. Any characters
        that are not in SUB_X will be encoded as NCRs (for example, &amp;#xABCD;), and
        will work.</li>
      <li>It is acceptable to generate the file with SUB_X, and tag the file as X.
      Everything works as
        long as the characters that are not in SUB_X are converted into NCRs.</li>
      <li>It is NOT acceptable to parse with SUB_X when the file is tagged with X
        because characters will be corrupted.</li>
      <li>It is NOT acceptable to generate the file with X, and tag the file with SUB_X
      because characters will be corrupted.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Therefore, looking up a best-fit character mapping needs to yield different 
  results depending on whether a subset or a superset is required. <a href="tr22-7.html#Names">Section 
  4</a>, <i>Alias Table Format</i> describes data that can be used for this.</p> 
  <h4>1.1.2 <a name="Dual_Substitution_Handling">Dual Substitution Handling</a></h4>
  <p>Some mapping tables for multibyte code pages define an additional, alternate
  code page substitution character &quot;subchar1&quot; which is always a
  single-byte code. In this case, the regular substitution character is always a
  double-byte code. These mapping tables then also list  which unassigned code points should map to this alternate subchar1 instead of
  to the regular substitution character.</p>
  <p>The XML character mapping table format provides for the specification of the
  &quot;subchar1&quot; byte sequence as a <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_sub1">sub1</a> <i>attribute</i> of the <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_assignments">assignments</a>
  element, and for the use of <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_sub1">sub1</a> <i>elements</i> to specify which Unicode code
  points should map to &quot;subchar1&quot; instead of to the regular
  substitution character.</p>
  <p>Usage:</p>
  <p>In this context characters are thought of as being &quot;wide&quot; or
  &quot;narrow.&quot; In legacy code pages, this is identified with the codes
  being single-byte or double-byte codes.</p>
  <p>In mappings between two legacy code pages: When a wide (double-byte)
  character is unassigned, it results in a double-byte substitution character.
  When a narrow (single-byte) character is unassigned, it results in a
  single-byte &quot;subchar1&quot;.</p>
  <p>This is emulated in mapping tables by declaring the additional &quot;subchar1&quot;, and by adding one-way mappings from Unicode to the code page-&quot;subchar1&quot;
      where desired for &quot;narrow&quot; characters. When a
  &quot;subchar1&quot; is specified, then conversion routines use U+001A as a &quot;Unicode subchar1.&quot;</p>
  <p>Typically, all unassigned Latin-1 characters (Unicode code points
  U+0000-U+00FF) have
  subchar1 mappings, but  some other code points do also.</p>
  <p>This means that when one converts from Unicode to such a code page and finds an
      unassigned code point, then if a &quot;subchar1&quot; mapping is defined for this code point,
          output the &quot;subchar1&quot; byte sequence, otherwise output the regular substitution character.
  When one converts from such a code page to Unicode and finds an
      unassigned code, then if the input sequence is of length 1 <em>and</em> a
          &quot;subchar1&quot; is specified for the code page, output U+001A, otherwise output
  U+FFFD.</p>
  <p>Some converter implementations seem to not distinguish between
  roundtrip/fallback/subchar[1] and just include the desired default results in the runtime mapping tables.</p>
  <h3>1.2 <a name="Completeness">Completeness</a></h3>
  <p>It is important that a mapping file be a complete description. Using the
  data in the file, it must be possible to tell
  whether any sequence of bytes is assigned, unassigned, or illegal. It must also be
  possible to tell if characters need to be rearranged to be in Unicode standard
  order (visual order, combining marks after base forms, etc). In addition,</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All mappings for control characters
      (C0 controls, DELETE, and C1 controls; U+0000..U+001F and U+007F..U+009F)
      must be explicitly listed if these characters are mapped.</li>
    <li>All legacy private use (for example, user defined) characters must be explicitly
      mapped, either to the private use zone in Unicode, or to the correct
      characters outside of that zone.</li>
    <li>Only a real legacy replacement character can be mapped explicitly to
      REPLACEMENT CHAR in the body of the mapping table; unassigned characters
      must not be mapped <i>explicitly</i> to it. (They may be mapped implicitly
      in conversion, depending on conversion parameters.)</li>
    <li>Similarly, when mapping from Unicode to a code page, only the REPLACEMENT CHAR
      (or U+001A in a table with <a href="tr22-7.html#Dual_Substitution_Handling">Dual Substitution Handling</a>)
      can be mapped to SUBSTITUTE or other legacy equivalent.</li>
    <li>Incomplete sequences and other illegal sequences must be explicitly
      indicated.</li>
    <li>All fallback mappings must be clearly indicated. This is especially
      important for modern software that guarantees round-trip conversion to and
      from Unicode.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If two byte sequences are considered to be duplicate encodings, then they
  can map to the same Unicode value, in which case one of them is a fallback.</p>

  <h3>1.3 <a name="Canonical_Equivalence">Canonical Equivalence</a></h3>                    
  <p>The Unicode Standard has two equivalent ways of representing accented characters such as <i>â</i>. The standard provides for two normalized formats                    
  that provide for unique representations of data in <a href="../tr15.1">UAX                    
  #15: Unicode Normalization Forms</a> [<a href="tr22-7.html#Normal">Normal</a>]. Where                    
  possible, each code page character should be mapped to a precomposed Unicode                    
  character, or to a Unicode sequence which is in Normalization Form C.                    
  However, this does not guarantee that the result of the conversion of the                    
  entire text into Unicode                    
  will be normalized, because individual characters in the source encoding may                    
  separately map to an unnormalized sequence.</p>                    
      <p>For example, suppose the source encoding maps 0x83 to U+030A in Unicode (<i>combining
    ring above</i>), and 0x61 to U+0061 (<i>a</i>). Then the sequence
    &lt;0x61,0x83&gt; will map to &lt;U+0061, U+030A&gt; in Unicode, which is
    not in Normalization Form C.</p>
  <p>This situation will only arise when the source encoding has separate
  characters that, in the proper context, would not be present in normalized
  text. If a process wishes to guarantee that the result is in a particular
  Unicode normalization form,  it should normalize after conversion. (See the
  description of the <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_normalization">normalization</a> attribute of the <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_characterMapping">characterMapping</a>
  element below.)</p>
  <h3>1.4 <a name="Charset_Alias_Matching">Charset Alias Matching</a></h3>
  <p>Names and aliases of charsets are often spelled with small variations. To recognize accidental but unambiguous misspellings and  avoid adding
  each possible variation to a list of recognized names, it is customary to
  match names case-insensitively and to ignore some punctuation. For best
  results,  names should be compared after applying the following
  transformations:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Delete all characters except a-z, A-Z, and 0-9.</li>
    <li>Map uppercase A-Z to the corresponding lowercase a-z.</li>
    <li>From left to right, delete each 0 that is not preceded by a digit.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>For example, the following names should match: &quot;UTF-8&quot;,
  &quot;utf8&quot;, &quot;u.t.f-008&quot;, but not &quot;utf-80&quot; or
  &quot;ut8&quot;.</p>
  <p>
  <b>Note:</b> These rules are in place because in practice
  implementations are faced with many gratuitous variations
  in the use and omission of punctuation.
  There are a small number of IANA names for different charsets
  that match under these rules, but they appear to be rarely used, obscure charsets:
  "iso-ir-9-1" and "iso-ir-9-2" match "iso-ir-91" and "iso-ir-92", respectively.
  (There are also names in the IANA charset registry that violate the registry's own name syntax rules.)
  </p>
  <h2>2 <a name="Conformance">Conformance</a></h2>
  <p>There are many different ways to describe character mapping
  tables and alias tables, and the Unicode Standard does not restrict the ways
  in which implementations can do this. However, any Unicode-conformant
  implementation that purports to implement this specification must do so as
  described in the following clause. Implementations are free to deviate from
  this, as long as they do not purport to conform to this specification.</p>

  <h2>3 <a name="XML_Format">Character Mapping Table Format</a></h2>
  <p>A character mapping specification file starts with the following lines. 
  Note that there is a difference between the encoding of the XML file, and the 
  encoding of the mapping data. The encoding of the file can be any valid XML 
  encoding. Only the characters in the ASCII   repertoire are required in the specification of the mapping data, but 
  the full repertoire of the mapping file's encoding may be used in comments and 
  in attribute values (where permitted by the specification). The example below happens to use UTF-8.</p> 
  <pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

&lt;!DOCTYPE characterMapping

  SYSTEM &quot;http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr22/CharacterMapping.dtd&quot;&gt;</pre>

    <p>In the rest of this specification, very short attribute and
    element names are used just to conserve space where there may be a large
    number of items, or for consistency with other elements that may have a
    large number of items.</p>

  <h3>3.1 <a name="Header">Header</a></h3>
  <p>A mapping file begins with a header. The following is not a real-world
  example but illustrates all of the attributes:</p>

  <p>The element <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_characterMapping" name="elem_characterMapping">characterMapping</a> (required) is the root. It contains a number of

  ></p>
  <p>The attribute <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_id" name="att_id">id</a> (required) gives a canonical identifier which uniquely
  distinguishes this
  mapping table from all others. This identifier has the form: &lt;source&gt;-&lt;name_on_source&gt;-&lt;version&gt;,
  such as &quot;iso-8859-1999&quot;. The identifier syntax was chosen so that the resulting string can be
    used as a filename on most systems.</p>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <td>&lt;source&gt;</td>
      <td>Name of standards authority, government, vendor, or product</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&lt;name_on_source&gt;</td>
      <td>Most common name used on source. If the name is used ambiguously on
      the source, it should be qualified for uniqueness: for example,
        &quot;cp936_Alt1&quot;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&lt;version&gt;</td>
      <td>Version number, typically the first year the encoding was introduced.
        If this is not sufficient for uniqueness, an additional letter can be
        appended: &quot;1999a&quot;, &quot;1999b&quot;, etc.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>All three fields must be present, except in the case of Unicode encodings, which do not need a version field. Fields are limited to ASCII 
  letters, digits and &quot;_&quot;. Any other characters should be converted to 
  &quot;_&quot; or letters. The <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_id">id</a> value is matched leniently as 
  recommended for all charset names, see <a href="tr22-7.html#Charset_Alias_Matching">Section 
  1.4</a>, <i>Charset Alias Matching</i>. It must be unique; if two mapping tables differ in the mapping of any 
  characters, in the specification of illegal characters, in their bidi 
  ordering, in their combining character ordering, and so on, then their identifiers must not 
  match according to the algorithm in <a href="tr22-7.html#Charset_Alias_Matching">Section 
  1.4</a>, <i>Charset Alias Matching</i>.</p> 

    <p>If a source only has one name for two mappings that differ by 
    bidi-order, one must be given a qualification. For example, &quot;cp543_RTL&quot; 
    (see below).</p> 
  <p>Different organizations may assign different <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_id">id</a>              
  values for the same mapping table, for example, if they happen to choose             
  different names for the same source or happen to document the same mapping             
  table from different sources.&nbsp;</p>            

    <p>These identifiers are <i>not</i> meant to compete with the <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets">IANA            
    character set registry</a> [<a href="tr22-7.html#IANA">IANA</a>], which is the most            
    useful collection of cross-platform names available. Future registration            
    of many of these mappings  with IANA seems likely because the            
    current usage of IANA names is not sufficiently precise. For example,  many character set mappings advertise themselves as being            
    &quot;Shift-JIS&quot;, but actually have different mappings to and from            
    Unicode on different platforms.</p>            

  <p>Some sources do not rename a character set when they add mappings by
  providing mappings for characters that were either previously unmapped or mapped to private use characters. These added mappings can be
  incorporated into the same mapping file, using a <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_version">version</a> attribute (see
  below). If only additions are made, then the same identifier can be retained. However,
  if mappings are changed in ways other than pure additions, then a new identifier
  <i>must</i> be used. Any change in the validity of character sequences also
  requires a new identifier.</p>
  <p>The attribute <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_version" name="att_version">version</a> (required)
  specifies the version of the data, a small integer
  normally starting at one. Any time the data is modified, the value must be
  increased.</p>
  <p>The attribute <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_description" name="att_description">description</a> (optional) contains a string which describes the mapping
  enough to distinguish it from other similar mappings. This string must be
  limited to the Unicode range U+0020 - U+007E and should be in English. The
  string normally contains the set of mappings, the script, language, or locale
  for which it is intended, and optionally the variation. For instance,
  &quot;Windows Japanese JIS-1990&quot;, &quot;EBCDIC Latin 1 with Euro&quot;,
  &quot;PC Greek&quot;.</p>
  <p>The attribute <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_contact" name="att_contact">contact</a> (optional) provides the person to contact in case errors are found
  in the data. This must be a URL.</p>
  <p>The attribute <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_registrationAuthority" name="att_registrationAuthority">registrationAuthority</a> (optional) indicates the organization responsible for
  the encoding.</p>
  <p>The attribute <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_registrationName" name="att_registrationName">registrationName</a> (optional) contains a string that provides the name and
  version of the mapping, as known to that authority.</p>
  <p>The attribute <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_copyright" name="att_copyright">copyright</a> (optional) provides the copyright information. While this
  can be provided in comments, use of an attribute allows copyright propagation
  when converting to a binary form of the table. (Typically the right to use the
  information is granted, but not the right to erase the copyright or imply that
  the implementer created the information.)</p>

  <p>The attribute <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bidiOrder" name="att_bidiOrder">bidiOrder</a> (optional) specifies whether the character encoding is to
  be interpreted in one of three orders: &quot;RTL&quot;, &quot;LTR&quot;, or
  &quot;logical&quot;. Unicode text is always stored and processed in<i> logical
  order</i> (basically keystroke order). Application of the Unicode
  Bidirectional Algorithm is required to map to a visual-order character
  encoding; application of a reverse bidirectional algorithm is required to map
  back to Unicode. The default value for this attribute is &quot;logical&quot;.
  It is only relevant for character encodings for the Arabic and Hebrew. For more information, see <a href="../tr9/index.html">UAX
  #9: The Bidirectional Algorithm</a> [<a href="tr22-7.html#BIDI">BIDI</a>]. If mapping
  tables differ only in <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bidiOrder">bidiOrder</a>,
  this should be reflected in the &lt;name_from_source&gt;,
  for example, &quot;cp999&quot;, &quot;cp999_RTL&quot;, &quot;cp999_LTR&quot;.</p>

  <p>The attribute <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_normalization" name="att_normalization">normalization</a> (optional)
  specifies whether the result of conversion 
  into Unicode using this mapping will be automatically in Normalization Form C 
  or D. The possible values are &quot;<b>undetermined</b>&quot; (the default), 
  &quot;<b>neither</b>&quot;, &quot;<b>NFC</b>&quot;, &quot;<b>NFD</b>&quot;, or 
  &quot;<b>NFC_NFD</b>&quot;. While this information can be derived from an 
  analysis of the assignment statements (see <a href="../tr15.1">UAX 
  #15: Unicode Normalization Forms</a> [<a href="tr22-7.html#Normal">Normal</a>]), providing 
  the information in the header is a useful validity check, and saves 
  processing. Most mappings specifications will have the value &quot;NFC&quot;. 
  Character encodings that contain neither composite characters nor combining 
  marks (such as 7-bit ASCII) will have the value &quot;NFC_NFD&quot;.
  For example,
  ISO Arabic is &quot;<b>neither</b>&quot; (because of the order of multiple combining marks)
  and ISO Latin-1 is &quot;<b>NFC</b>&quot;.</p>
  <p><b>Note:</b>
  Any charset that contains combining marks with different, non-zero values
  for the Canonical_Combining_Class property
  cannot be marked either as &quot;<b>NFC</b>&quot; or as &quot;<b>NFD</b>&quot;.</p>

  <p>The attribute <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_combiningOrder" name="att_combiningOrder">combiningOrder</a> (optional)
  specifies whether combining marks are stored after their base character
  (as in Unicode) or before their base character (as in some legacy charsets).</p>
      <h3>3.2 <a name="History">History</a></h3>
  <pre> &lt;history&gt;

 &lt;/history&gt;</pre>
  <p>The element <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_history" name="elem_history">history</a> (optional) provides information about the changes to the

  <p class="dtd">&lt;!ELEMENT history (modified+)></p> 
  <p>The element <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_modified" name="elem_modified">modified</a> provides information about the changes to the file,

  <h3>3.3 <a name="Validity_Specification">Validity Specification</a></h3>
  <p>As discussed above, it is important to be able to distinguish whether

  <p>The attribute
  <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_type" name="att_type">type</a> (required) specifies the type of the given bytes. The one
    distinguished value for this attribute is <b>FIRST</b>. Other values can be
      assigned, as long as they do not cause an error condition, as listed below.</p>
  <p>The attribute <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_s" name="att_s">s</a> (required) specifies the start of the byte range.
  <p>The attribute <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_e" name="att_e">e</a> (optional) specifies the end of the byte range. A missing value is interpreted as being the same as the value for
  the <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_s">s</a>
  attribute (thus is a range with one single value).
<p>The attribute
  <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_next" name="att_next">next</a> (required) specifies the resulting type. There are three distinguished
  values. Other values (identifiers) can be freely chosen, as long as they do not
      cause an error condition.
  <p>The distinguished values are <b>VALID</b>, <b>INVALID</b>, and <b>UNASSIGNED</b>.
  <b>VALID</b> indicates valid completion and is the default value for the state
  element. <b>INVALID</b> indicates that the sequence is invalid. <b>UNASSIGNED</b> indicates that the sequence is valid, but that
          none of the matching byte sequences are assigned.</p>
  <p>The attribute
  <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_max" name="att_max">max</a> (optional) can only occur if the <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_next">next</a> value is <b>VALID</b>.
      Its value must be greater or equal to the largest possible Unicode code point for
      any matching byte sequence.</p>
  <p>For a pure definition of the mapping tables, neither <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_max">max</a> nor
  <b>UNASSIGNED</b> or <b>INVALID</b>
  are necessary.
  <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_max">max</a> and <b>UNASSIGNED</b>
  could both be determined by analyzing the assignment
  statements in the table. However, their inclusion allows implementations to
  optimize their internal tables.
  <b>INVALID</b> can be used as explicit documentation of invalid byte sequences.</p>
  <p>All values referring to code units are hexadecimal. Looking at the above 
  table, the first three lines show that the single bytes 00-80, A0-DF, FD-FF 
  are legal. The next two lines say that the bytes in the ranges 81-9F and 
  E0-FC are legal, <i>if</i> they are followed by a byte of <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_type">type</a>=<b>&quot;LAST&quot;</b>. 
  The next two lines show that the LAST byte must be in 40-7E, 80-FC More 
  detailed samples for a complex validity specification are given in <a href="tr22-7.html#Samples">Section 
  5</a>, <i>Samples</i>.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> The byte sequences in assignment statements are a <i>subset</i>
    of the valid byte sequences. There can be 0, a few, or very many valid
    byte sequences that are not listed in assignment elements.
    <b>UNASSIGNED</b> can be used to optimize internal tables.
  </p>
  <p>The validity specification is interpreted by setting the current state to <b>FIRST</b>,
  and using the following process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fetch a byte.</li>
    <li>From the current state and that byte, find the <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_next">next</a> value.</li>
    <li>If it is <b>VALID</b>, then the sequence is valid.</li>
    <li>If it is <b>INVALID</b> or there is no state, then the sequence is
      invalid.</li>
    <li>Otherwise set the current state to the <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_next">next</a> value.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following is a sample of how this could be implemented in Java. It
  would be very similar in C or C++ except that <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_type">type</a> would be an
  output parameter and not an array, and the mask with <code>0xFF</code> is
  unnecessary if byte is a typedef for <code>unsigned char</code>.</p>

  <h4><a name="Simple_SI_SO-Stateful_Encodings">3.3.2 Simple SI/SO-Stateful
  Encodings</a></h4>
  <p>EBCDIC-based multi-byte encodings use exactly two states and change between
  them with Shift-In and Shift-Out (SI/SO) ISO control codes. There are a few
  ASCII-based SI/SO encodings as well. (As it happens, the byte values for SI
  and SO are the same in EBCDIC and ASCII.)</p>
  <p>Such stateful encodings are announced and tracked with a single CCSID (IBM
  encoding ID) and are listed in the ICU Unicode conversion table repository [<a href="tr22-7.html#ConvRef">Conv</a>]
  with one single mapping table that lists mappings for both states. The
  mappings are implicitly (and at runtime) distinguished by the number of
  bytes per character: 1 in the initial state, and 2 in the other state. Note
  that the double-byte lead byte ranges overlap a lot with the single-byte
  codes.</p>
  <p>These encodings are expressed in the XML character mapping tables by defining two 
  validity specifications, one for the single-byte state, and one for the 
  double-byte state. A <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_stateful_siso" name="elem_stateful_siso">stateful_siso</a> element is used instead of the 
  normal <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_validity">validity </a>element, and <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_stateful_siso">stateful_siso</a> itself 
  contains two <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_validity">validity</a> elements.</p> 
  <p class="dtd">&lt;!ELEMENT stateful_siso (validity, validity)></p> 
  <p>In the assignment elements below, the mappings for the two states need not
  be in any particular order.</p>
  <p>Example:</p>

  <p>The value of the <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_sub1" name="att_sub1">sub1</a>  attribute is one byte; if it is missing, then the encoding uses

  The attribute   
  <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_b" name="att_b">b</a> (required) contains a sequence of bytes.   
  Each byte always has two unsigned hex digits. Multiple values are separated by spaces.   
  <p>The attribute <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_u" name="att_u">u</a> (required) contains a sequence of Unicode code points.  
  Each code point has one or more  
      unsigned hex digits. Multiple values must be separated by spaces. Where  
      possible, this should be in Normalization Form C.  
  <p>The attribute <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_v" name="att_v">v</a> (optional) specifies the version.
      It has the same format as the &lt;version&gt; field

      in <a href="tr22-7.html#Header">Section 3.1</a>, <i>Header</i>.
      There is no default value.</p>

  <p>The <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_v">v</a> version matches the version part 
      of a mapping table <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_id">id</a>

      attribute in the mapping table history (see <a href="tr22-7.html#History">Section 3.2</a>, 
  <i>History</i>) 
      which is incremented even for editorial changes.</p> 

  <p>If someone requests a mapping table of a certain version, such as
          &quot;source-myname-1999b&quot;, then any table with a later version
          can be used, such as &quot;source-myname-2000&quot;. All the
          assignment elements in the later file that have a version that is
          lexically less than or equal to the requested version are used.
  <p>If there are any such assignment elements that would conflict except
          for version, then the lexically larger version is chosen.
  <p>The attribute <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_c" name="att_c">c</a> (optional) provides the actual character(s) expressed in <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_u">u</a>.

  <p>The element <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_range" name="elem_range">range</a> specifies that a range of byte sequences and    
  Unicode values map together. It is simply a way to abbreviate a list of <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_a">a</a>    
  elements. The attributes are <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bFirst">bFirst</a>, <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bLast">bLast</a>, <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_uFirst">uFirst</a>, <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_uLast">uLast</a>,    
  <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bMin">bMin</a>, <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bMax">bMax</a> and <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_v">v</a>. The range of Unicode code points varies    
  continuously from <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_uFirst" name="att_uFirst">uFirst</a> to <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_uLast" name="att_uLast">uLast</a>. For enumerating the byte    
  sequences, the values are incremented from <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bFirst" name="att_bFirst">bFirst</a> to <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bLast" name="att_bLast">bLast</a> in    
  lexical order. That is, the last byte is incremented. If the byte value    
  exceeds the corresponding byte in <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bMax" name="att_bMax">bMax</a>, it is reset to the    
  corresponding byte in <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bMin" name="att_bMin">bMin</a>, and the previous byte in the sequence is    
  incremented. This process is repeated for each of the bytes from <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bFirst">bFirst</a>    
  to <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bLast">bLast</a>. The <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_v">v</a> attribute is interpreted the same as it is in

  <h4>3.4.1 <a name="Multiple_Characters">Mapping Multiple Characters</a></h4>

  <p>A mapping may specify multiple characters on the Unicode
  side  in the <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_u">u</a> attribute, the code page side  in the <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_b">b</a>
  attribute, or both. Such mappings are used when Unicode represents a code page
  character with a character sequence, for example U+304B U+309A for a
  Ka with a semi-voiced mark in JIS X 0213.</p>

  <p>Each one of the multiple Unicode code points must be
  represented by a hexadecimal number between 0000 and 10FFFF, for example &quot;304B 309A&quot;.</p>

  <p>A multi-character byte sequence must consist of consecutive
  complete single-character byte sequences that are each valid according to the
  validity specification. For example, with the windows-932-2000 validity
  specification, the byte sequence &quot;84 44 45 E2 F3&quot; is a valid
  three-character byte sequence, but &quot;84 44 45 E2&quot; is not valid
  because it contains one incomplete byte sequence &quot;E2&quot; after two
  valid ones (&quot;84 44&quot; and &quot;45&quot;).</p>

  <h4>3.4.2 <a name="Assignment_Error_Conditions">Error Conditions</a></h4>

<p>All byte sequences that are specified in assignment elements
      must be valid according to the validity
      specification. <i>Otherwise the file is invalid.</i> Each byte sequence must consist of
one or more complete
          single-character byte sequences that are each valid according to the
          validity specification. Otherwise the file is invalid.
          If an assignment element's byte sequence is <b>UNASSIGNED</b> in the validity
          specification, the file is invalid.</p>
All Unicode code point sequences must contain one or                    
      more Unicode code points, each represented by                    
  a hexadecimal number between 0000 and 10FFFF. <i>Otherwise the file is invalid.</i>                    
 If a code point exceeds the <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_max">max</a> value in the validity                    
          specification associated with the byte sequence in that assignment                    
          statement, it is invalid. If <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_normalization">normalization</a> is specified in the header to be &quot;<b>NFC</b>&quot;,                    
          &quot;<b>NFD</b>&quot;, or &quot;<b>NFC_NFD</b>&quot;, then the code                    
          point sequence must be valid in the respective normalization form.                    
  <p>This specification does not require that Unicode code point
  sequences are well-formed UTF-32 code unit sequences. Therefore, the use of
  CharMapML in and of itself does not guarantee that the result of a mapping is
  in a Unicode Encoding Form.</p>
<p>Sequences cannot map assigned legacy characters to Unicode code points that are unassigned in the latest version of the Unicode Standard. They can map unassigned legacy code positions to unassigned Unicode code points, where those unassigned legacy code positions are defined as corresponding to Unicode code points, such as is done in GB 18030.
If there are valid characters in the legacy encoding that are
              not yet in Unicode, they must be mapped to private use characters
              if they are mapped: (E000..F8FF, E0000..EFFFD, 100000..10FFFD).</p>
A <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_range">range</a> is treated as if it were expanded to a list of <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_a">a</a>                    
      elements in terms of assessing the validity of the mapping table. In                    
      addition, the element is invalid if:                    
      <ul>
        <li><a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bFirst">bFirst</a>, <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bLast">bLast</a>, <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bMin">bMin</a>, <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bMax">bMax </a> do not all
          have the same number of bytes.</li>
        <li>Each byte in <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bFirst">bFirst</a>, <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bLast">bLast</a> is not between the
          corresponding bytes in <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bMin">bMin</a>, <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bMax">bMax.</a></li>
        <li><a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_bLast">bLast</a> does not match the final byte sequence reached in the
          process of generating the <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_a">a</a> elements.</li>
      </ul>
The <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_sub1">sub1</a> attribute of assignments must be exactly one byte if specified.                    
      <i>Otherwise the file is invalid.</i>
<p>A <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_sub1">sub1</a> element must not be used without specifying the <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#att_sub1">sub1</a>
      attribute of <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_assignments">assignments</a>. <i>Otherwise the file is invalid.</i>
<p>For the purpose of validity (and selecting versions) an <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_a">a</a> element
      is treated as if it expanded into an <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_fub">fub</a> element and an <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_fbu">fbu</a>
      element.
<p>An <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_fub">fub</a> or <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_sub1">sub1</a> element conflicts with any other <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_fub">fub</a>
      or <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_sub1">sub1</a> element that has the same Unicode code
point sequence and the same
      version.
<p>An <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_fbu">fbu</a> element conflicts with any other <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_fbu">fbu</a> element that
      has the same byte sequence and the same version.
<p><i>In the case of conflicts, the file is invalid.</i>
  <h3>3.5 <a name="ISO_2022">ISO 2022</a></h3>
  <p>Country- or vendor-specific ISO 2022 [<a href="tr22-7.html#ISO2022">ISO2022</a>] encodings are used frequently on the
  Internet. They each use a subset of the ISO 2022 framework and allow only few
  embedded encodings. The &quot;very stateful&quot; nature of an ISO 2022
  encoding makes it infeasible to describe it fully with one  XML file. Instead, the XML character mapping table format provides for a kind of
  table of contents for an ISO 2022 encoding as an alternative to the usual
  validity specification(s) and assignments. It allows the identification of the
  invocation sequences and state shifts that are associated with each mapping
  table (identified by its canonical name). It does not fully specify all the elements and semantics of the particular ISO 2022 subset.</p>
  <p><i>ISO 2022 Terminology:</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>An <i>escape sequence</i> announces an embedded encoding and  immediately changes to that encoding.</p>
    <p>A <i>designator sequence</i> announces an embedded encoding but does not
    cause an immediate change to that encoding. Instead, such a change is later
    invoked with a permanent Shift-In or Shift-Out (SI/SO) control code, or with
    a one-time Single-Shift 2 or 3 (SS2/SS3).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In the XML format, designator sequences are listed under the codes that 
  shift to them. The details of how designator sequences interact with shift 
  codes are not specified in the XML format. The initial state is generally 
  US-ASCII. Otherwise, it must be specified with a <a class="charclass" href="tr22-7.html#elem_default2022" name="elem_default2022">default2022</a> 
  element.</p>

  <h3>5.2 <a name="UTF8_Sample">UTF-8 Sample</a></h3>
  <p>While
  a mapping file is never required for UTF-8 in practice because it is
  algorithmically derived, it is instructive to see the use of the validity
  element in examples.</p>
  <h4>5.2.1 <a name="Partial_Validity_Checks">Partial Validity Checks</a></h4>
  <p>Here is a simple version of the UTF-8 validity specification, with the
  shortest-form bounds checking, surrogates, and exact limit bounds checking
  omitted. This specification only checks the bounds for the first byte, and
  that there are the appropriate number (0, 1, 2, or 3) of following bytes in
  the right ranges. The single byte form does not need to be explicitly set; it
  is simply any single byte that neither is illegal nor requires additional
  bytes.</p>
