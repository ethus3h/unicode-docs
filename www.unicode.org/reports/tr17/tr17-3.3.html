  <h2>1 <a name="CharacterEncodingModel">The Character Encoding Model</a></h2>
  <p><span class="changed">This report describes a model for the structure 
  of character encodings. The Unicode Character Encoding Model places the Unicode 
  Standard in the context of other character encodings of all types as well as 
  existing models such as the character architecture promoted by the Internet 
  Architecture Board (<a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#IAB">IAB</a>) for use on the internet or the 
  Character Data Representation Architecture (<a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CDRA">CDRA</a>) defined 
  by IBM  for organizing and cataloging its own vendor-specific array of character 
  encodings. The focus of this document is on how these models should be extended and 
  clarified to cover all the aspects</span> of the Unicode Standard and <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#ISO">ISO</a>/<a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#IEC">IEC</a> 10646.
  (For a list of common acronyms used in this text, see 
  <a href="tr17-3.3.html#DefinitionsAndAcronyms"><i>Definitions and Acronyms</i></a>).</p>
  <p>The IAB model, as defined in <span class="changed">[<a href="tr17-3.3.html#RFC2130">RFC 2130</a>], 
  distinguishes three levels:</span> <i>Coded Character Set</i> (<a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CCS">CCS</a>), <i>Character 
  Encoding Scheme</i> (<a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CES">CES</a>), and <i>Transfer Encoding Syntax</i> (<a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#TES">TES</a>). However, to 
  adequately cover the distinctions required for the <span class="changed">Unicode</span>
  character encoding model, <i>five</i> levels need to be defined. One of these, the 
  <i><span class="changed">Abstract Character R</span>epertoire</i>, is implicit in 
  the IAB model. The other is an additional level between the CCS and the CES.</p>
  <p>The five levels <span class="changed">of the Unicode Character Encoding Model</span>
  can be summarized as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b><a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#ACR">ACR</a>:</b> Abstract Character Repertoire
      <ul style="list-style:none">
        <li><i>the set of characters to be encoded, e.g., some alphabet or 
          symbol set</i></li>
      </ul>
    <li><b><a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CCS">CCS</a>:</b> Coded Character Set
      <ul style="list-style:none">
        <li><i>a mapping from an abstract character repertoire to a set of 
          non-negative integers</i></li>
      </ul>
    <li><b><a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CEF">CEF</a>:</b> Character Encoding Form
      <ul style="list-style:none">
        <li><i>a mapping from a set of non-negative integers (from a CCS) to a 
          set of sequences of particular code units of some specified width, 
          such as <span class="changed">32-bit integers</span></i></li>
      </ul>
    <li><b><a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CES">CES</a>:</b> Character Encoding Scheme
      <ul style="list-style:none">
        <li><i>a mapping from a set of sequences of codes units (from one or 
          more CEFs) to a serialized sequence of bytes 
          <span class="changed">or octets</span></i></li>
      </ul>
    <li><b><a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#TES">TES</a>:</b> Transfer Encoding Syntax
      <ul style="list-style:none">
        <li><i>a reversible transform of encoded data. This data may or may not 
          contain textual data</i></li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="changed">In addition to the five individual levels, there is the
  useful concept of a <i>Character Map (<a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CM">CM</a>)</i>, which is an operation that bridges
  all five levels. It</span> is 
  defined as a mapping from an abstract character repertoire to a serialized sequence
  of bytes <span class="changed"> or octets. (In <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#ISO">ISO</a> standards the term <i>octet</i> is 
  used for an 8-bit byte).</span></p>
  <p><span class="changed">The following sections give sample definitions, explanations and 
  examples for each of the five levels, the Character Map, and the Transfer Encoding 
  Syntax, followed by a discussion of <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#API">API</a> Binding issues and a complete list of Acronyms 
  used in this document.</span></p>
  <h2>2 Abstract Character <a name="Repertoire">Repertoire</a></h2>
  <p>A <i><span class="changed">Character R</span>epertoire</i> is defined as 
  <span class="changed">an unordered</span> 
  set of abstract characters to be encoded. The word <i>abstract</i> 
  just means that these objects are defined by convention. <span class="changed">In many cases a 
  repertoire consists of</span> a familiar alphabet or symbol set.</p>
  <p>Repertoires come in two types: <i>fixed</i> and <i>open</i>. 
  For most character encodings, the repertoire is fixed (and often small). Once 
  the repertoire is decided upon, it is never changed. Addition of a new 
  abstract character to a given repertoire is conceived of as creating a new 
  repertoire, which then will be given its own catalogue number, constituting a 
  new object.</p>
  <p>For the Unicode Standard, on the other hand, the repertoire is inherently 
  open. Because Unicode is intended to be the universal encoding, any abstract 
  character that ever could be encoded is potentially a member of the actual set 
  to be encoded, whether we currently know of that character or not.</p>
  <p><span class="changed">Some other character sets</span> use a limited 
  notion of open repertoires. <span class="changed">For example, Microsoft has
  on occasions extended the repertoire of its Windows character sets</span>
  by adding a handful of characters to an existing 
  repertoire. This occurred when the <span class="name">EURO SIGN</span> was added to the 
  repertoire for a number of Windows character sets, for example.</p>
  <p>Repertoires are the things that in the IBM <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CDRA">CDRA</a> architecture get <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CS">CS</a> 
  (“character set” ) values.</p>
  <p>Examples <span class="changed">of Character Repertoires</span>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the Japanese syllabaries and ideographs of <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#JIS">JIS</a> X 0208 (= CS 01058) 
      [fixed]
    <li>the Western European alphabets and symbols of Latin-1 (= CS 00697) 
      [fixed]
    <li>the POSIX portable character repertoire [fixed]
    <li>the IBM host Japanese repertoire (= CS 01001) [fixed]
    <li>the Windows Western European repertoire [open]
    <li>the Unicode/10646 repertoire [open]
  </ul>
  <h3><a name="Versioning">2.1 Versioning</a></h3>
  <p>The Unicode Standard versions its repertoire by publication of major and 
  minor editions of the standard: 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 3.0,... The repertoire for 
  each version is defined by the enumeration of abstract characters included in 
  that version.</p>
  <p><span class="changed">Except for several discontinuities affecting
  the backwards compatibility to the earliest </span> versions (1.0 and 1.1), 
  occasioned <span class="changed">among other</span> by the merger with <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#ISO">ISO</a>/<a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#IEC">IEC</a> 10646,
  <span class="changed">repertoire extensions for the Unicode Standard are strictly additive:</span>
  Starting with version 2.0 and continuing forward indefinitely into future versions,
  no character once included is ever removed from the repertoire<span class="changed">, 
  as defined in the Unicode Stability Policy [<a href="tr17-3.3.html#Stability">Stability</a>].</span></p>
  <p><span class="changed">The versioning of the repertoire is different from the 
  versioning of the Unicode Standard as a whole, in particular the Unicode Character
  Database [<a href="tr17-3.3.html#UCD">UCD</a>], which defines Character Properties (see also 
  [<a href="tr17-3.3.html#Prop">Prop</a>]). There are <i>update versions</i> of the text of the Unicode
  standard and of Unicode Character Database between major and minor versions of
  the Unicode Standard. While these update versions may amend character properties and
  descriptions of character behavior, they do not add to the character repertoire. 
  For more information about versions of the Unicode Standard see 
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions">Versions of the Unicode Standard</a>
  [<a href="tr17-3.3.html#Versions">Versions</a>].</span></p>
  <p>ISO/IEC 10646 has a different mechanism of extending its repertoire. The 
  10646 repertoire is extended by a formal amendment process. As each individual 
  amendment <span class="changed">containing additional characters is published, it
  extends</span> the 10646 repertoire. 
  The repertoires of the Unicode Standard and of ISO/IEC 10646 <span class="changed">are 
  kept</span> in alignment by coordinating the publication of major versions 
  of the Unicode Standard with the publication of a well-defined list of amendments 
  for 10646 (or a major revision and republication of 10646).</p>
  <h3>2.1 <a name="CharactersVsGlyphs">Characters vs. Glyphs</a></h3>
  <p><span class="changed">The elements of the Character Repertoire are abstract 
  <i>characters</i>. Characters are different from <i>glyphs</i>, which are the
  </span> particular images which represent a character or part of a 
  character. <span class="changed">Glyphs for the same character</span> may have 
  very different shapes:  below are just some of the possibilities for the letter 
  <b><i>a</i></b>.</p>

  <p>Glyphs do not correspond one-for-one with characters. For example, a 
  sequence of <i>“f”&nbsp; </i>followed by <i>“i” </i> &nbsp;may be represented with a single 
  glyph, called an <i>fi ligature.</i> Notice that the shapes are merged 
  together, and the dot is missing from the <i>“i” .</i></p>

  <p>On the other hand, the same image as the <i>fi ligature</i> could 
  <span class="changed">theoretically also</span> be 
  achieved by a sequence of two glyphs with the right shapes. The choice of 
  whether to use a single glyph or a sequence of two is up to the font

  <p>Similarly, an accented character could be represented by a single glyph, or 
  by different component glyphs positioned appropriately. In addition, the 
  separate accents can also be considered characters in their own right, in 
  which case a sequence of characters can also correspond to different possible 
  glyph representations:</p>

  <p>In non-Latin <span class="changed">scripts</span>, the connection between glyphs and characters 
  <span class="changed">are at times</span>
  even less direct. Glyphs may be required to change their shape<span class="changed">, position</span> and 
  widths depending on the surrounding glyphs. <span class="changed">Such</span> glyphs are called contextual 
  forms. For example, see the Arabic glyphs below.</p>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="2">
    <tr>
      <th>Character</th>
      <th colspan="4">Possible Glyphs, depending on context</th>

  </table>
  <p>Glyphs may also need to be widened for justification instead of simply 
  adding width to the spaces. Ideally this would involve changing the shape of 
  the glyph depending on the desired width. On some systems, this widening may 
  be achieved by inserting extra connecting glyphs called <i>kashidas</i>. In 
  such a case, a single&nbsp; character may conceivably correspond to a whole 
  sequence of <i>kashidas + glyphs + kashidas</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="changed"><i>Compatibility characters</i></span></p>
  <p>For historical reasons, abstract character repertoires may include many

  character repertoire. These <span class="changed">so-called compatibility 
  characters</span> may include 
  ligature glyphs, contextual form glyphs, glyphs that vary by width, sequences 
  of characters, and adorned glyphs (such as circled numbers). Below are some 
  examples where these are encoded as single characters in Unicode. As with 
  glyphs, there are not necessarily one-to-one relationships between characters 
  and code points.</p>
  <p>What an end-user thinks of as a single character (aka a <i>grapheme</i>) 
  may in fact be represented by multiple code points; conversely, a single code 
  point may correspond to multiple characters. Here are some examples:</p>

  <h3>2.2 <a name="Subsets">Subsets</a></h3>
  <p>Unlike most character repertoires, <span class="changed"> the synchronized repertoire 
  of Unicode and </span>10646 is intended to be <i>universal</i> in coverage. Given the
  complexity of many writing systems, in practice this implies that nearly all 
  implementations will <span class="changed">fully support only</span> some subset of the 
  total repertoire, rather than all the characters.</p>
  <p>Formal subset mechanisms are occasionally seen in implementations of some 
  Asian character sets, where for example, the distinction between “Level 1 
  JIS”&nbsp; and “Level 2 JIS”&nbsp; support refers to particular parts of 
  the repertoire of the <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#JIS">JIS</a> X 0208 kanji characters to be included in the 
  implementation.</p>
  <p>Subsetting is a major formal aspect of <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#ISO">ISO</a>/<a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#IEC">IEC</a> 10646. The standard 
  includes a set of internal catalog numbers for named subsets, and further 
  makes a distinction between subsets that are <i>fixed collections</i> and 
  those that are <i>open collections</i>, defined by a range of code positions. 
  <span class="changed">Open collections are extended any time an 
  addition to the repertoire gets encoded in a code position 
  between the range limits defining the collection. When the last of its open code 
  positions is filled, an open collection automatically becomes a fixed collection.</span> 
  <p><span class="changed">The European Committee for Standardization (<a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CEN">CEN</a>) 
  has defined several multilingual European subsets of ISO/IEC 10646-1 (called MES-1, 
  MES-2, MES-3A, and MES-3B). MES-1 and MES-2 have been added as named fixed collections
  in 10646.</span></p>
  <p>For the Unicode Standard, <span class="changed">there are neither predefined subsets nor
  a formal syntax for their definition</span>. It is considered up to 
  <span class="changed">each</span> implementation to define and support the subset of the 
  universal repertoire that it wishes to interpret.</p>
  <h2>3 <a name="CodedCharacterSet">Coded Character Set (CCS)</a></h2>
  <p>A <i>coded character set</i> is defined to be a mapping from a set of 
  abstract characters to the set of non-negative integers. This range of 
  integers need not be contiguous.  <span class="changed">In the Unicode Standard, the concept 
  </span> of the Unicode scalar value (cf. D28, in chapter 3 of the Unicode Standard) 
  <span class="changed">explicitly defines such a non-contiguous range of integers.</span></p>
  <p>An abstract character is defined to be <i>in a coded character set</i> if 
  the coded character set maps from it to an integer. That integer is said to be 
  the <i>code point</i> <span class="changed"> to which the abstract character has been
  <i>assigned</i></span>. That abstract character is then an <i>encoded character</i>.</p>
  <p>Coded character sets are the basic object that both <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#ISO">ISO</a> and 
  vendor character encoding committees produce. They relate a defined repertoire 
  to nonnegative integers, which then can be used unambiguously to refer to 
  particular abstract characters from the repertoire.</p>

  <p>A coded character set may also be known as a <i>character encoding</i>, a <i>coded 
  character repertoire</i>, a <i>character set definition</i>, or a <i>code page</i>.</p>
  <p>In the IBM <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CDRA">CDRA</a> architecture, <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CP">CP</a> (“code page” ) values refer to coded 
  character sets. (Note that this use of the term <i>code page</i> is quite 
  precise and limited. It should not be — but generally is — 
  confused with the generic use of <i>code page</i> to refer to character 
  encoding schemes. See below.)</p>

  <h3>3.1 <a name="CharacterNaming">Character Naming</a></h3>
  <p><span class="changed">SC2, the <a href="tr17-3.3.html#JTC1">JTC1</a> subcommittee responsible 
  for character coding,</span> requires the assignment 
  of a unique character name for each abstract character in the repertoire 
 <span class="changed">of its coded character sets</span>. This practice is not generally followed in vendor coded character 
  sets or the encodings produced by standards committees outside SC2, where the 
  names provided for characters, if any, are often variable and annotative, 
  rather than normative parts of the character encoding.</p>
  <p>The main rationale for the SC2 practice of character naming was to provide 
  a mechanism to unambiguously identify abstract characters across different 
  repertoires given different mappings to integers in different coded character 
  sets. Thus <span class="name">LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH GRAVE</span> would be the <i>same</i> 
  abstract character, even when it occurred in different repertoires and was 
  assigned different integers, depending on the particular coded character set.</p>
  <p><span class="changed">The IBM <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CDRA">CDRA</a>, on the other hand, ensures</span> character 
  identity across different coded 
  character sets (or “code pages” ) by assigning a catalogue number, 
  known as a <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#GCGID">GCGID</a> (graphic character 
  glyphic identifier), to every abstract character used in any of the 
  repertoires accounted for by the CDRA. Abstract characters that have the same 
  GCGID in two different coded character sets are by definition the same 
  character. Other vendors have made use of similar internal identifier systems 
  for abstract characters.</p>
  <p>The advent of Unicode/10646 has largely rendered such schemes obsolete. The 
  identity of abstract characters in all other coded character sets is 
  increasingly being defined by reference to Unicode/10646 itself. Part of the 
  pressure to include every “character”&nbsp; from every existing coded 
  character set into the Unicode Standard results from the desire by many to get 
  rid of subsidiary mechanisms for tracking bits and pieces, odds and ends that 
  aren't part of Unicode, and instead just make use of the Unicode 
  Standard as the universal catalog of characters.</p>
  <h3>3.2 <a name="CodeSpaces">Code Spaces</a></h3>
  <p>The range of nonnegative integers used for the mapping of abstract 
  characters defines a related concept of <i>code space</i>. Traditional 
  boundaries for types of code spaces are closely tied to the encoding forms 
  (see below), since the mappings of abstract characters to nonnegative integers 
  are not done arbitrarily, but with particular encoding forms in mind. Examples 
  of significant code spaces are 0..7F, 0..FF, 0..FFFF, 0..10FFFF, 0..7FFFFFFF, 
  0..FFFFFFFF.</p>
  <p>Code spaces can also have fairly elaborate structures, depending on 
  whether the range of integers is conceived of as contiguous, or whether 
  particular ranges of values are disallowed. Most complications result 
  from considerations of encoding form; when an encoding form specifies that the 
  integers used in encoding are to be realized as sequences of octets, there are 
  often constraints placed on the particular values that those octets may have 
  — mostly to avoid control code points. Expressed back in terms of code 
  space, this results in multiple ranges of integers that are disallowed for 
  mapping a character repertoire. (See [<a href="tr17-3.3.html#Lunde">Lunde</a>] for 
  two-dimensional diagrams of typical code spaces for Asian coded character 
  sets.)</p>
  <h2>4 <a name="CharacterEncodingForm">Character Encoding Form</a> (CEF)</h2>
  <p>A <i>character encoding form</i> is a mapping from the set of integers used 
  in a <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CCS">CCS</a> to the set of sequences of code units. A <i>code unit</i> is an 
  integer occupying a specified binary width in a computer architecture, such as 
  an 8-bit byte. The encoding form enables character representation as actual 
  data in a computer. The sequences of code units do not necessarily have the 
  same length.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A character encoding form whose sequences are all of the same length is 
      known as <i>fixed width</i>.
    <li>A character encoding form whose sequences are not all of the same length 
      is known as <i>variable width</i>.
  </ul>
  <p>A character encoding form <i>for a coded character set</i> is defined to be 
  a character encoding form that maps all of the encoded characters for that 
  coded character set.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Note: </i></b>In many cases, there is only one character encoding 
    form for a given coded character set. In some such cases only the character 
    encoding form has been specified. This leaves the coded character set 
    implicitly defined, based on an implicit relation between the code unit 
    sequences and integers.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When interpreting a sequence of code units, there are three possibilities:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The sequence is <i>illegal.</i> There are two variants of this:<br>
      First is where the sequence is <i>incomplete</i>. For example,
      <ul>
        <li>0xA3 is incomplete in CP950.
          <ul>
            <li>Unless followed by another byte of the right form, it is 
              illegal.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>0xD800 is incomplete in Unicode.
          <ul>
            <li>Unless followed by another 16-bit value of the right form, it is 
              illegal.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      The second variant is where the sequence is complete, but explicitly 
      illegal. For example,
      <ul>
        <li>0xFFFF is illegal in Unicode. This value can never occur in valid 
          Unicode text, and will never be assigned.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The sequence represents a valid code point, but is <i>unassigned</i>. 
      This sequence may be given an assignment in some future, <i>evolved</i> 
      version of the character encoding.<br>
      For example,
      <ul>
        <li>0xA3 0xBF is unassigned in CP950, as of 1999.</li>
        <li>0x0EDE is unassigned in Unicode, V3.0</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The source sequence is <i>assigned</i>: it represents a valid encoded 
      character. There are two variants of this:<br>
      First is a standard assigned character. For example,
      <ul>
        <li>0x0EDD is assigned in Unicode, V3.0</li>
      </ul>
      The second variant is a user-defined character. For example,
      <ul>
        <li>0xE000 is an assigned user-defined character whose semantic 
          interpretation is left to agreement between parties outside of the 
          context of the standard.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The encoding form for a <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CCS">CCS</a> may result in either fixed-width or 
  variable-width <span class="changed">sequences</span> of code units 
  associated with abstract characters. 
  The encoding form may involve an arbitrary reversible mapping of the integers 
  of the CCS to a set of code unit sequences.</p>
  <p>Encoding forms come in various types. Some of them are exclusive to the 
  Unicode/10646, whereas others represent general patterns that are repeated 
  over and over for hundreds of coded character sets. Here are of some of the 
  more important examples of encoding forms.</p>

  <p>Examples of variable-width encoding forms:</p>

      <ul style="list-style:none">

        <li>used only with Unicode/10646: a mix of one to two 16 bit code units</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>The encoding form defines one of the fundamental <span class="changed">aspects 
  of an encoding</span> that 
  internationalized software cares about: how many code units are there for each 
  character. This used to be expressed in terms of how many bytes each character 
  was represented by. With the introduction of <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#UCS">UCS</a>-2, <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#UTF">UTF</a>-16, UCS-4, and UTF-32 
  with wider code units for Unicode and 10646, this is generalized to two pieces 
  of information: a specification of the width of the code unit, <i>and</i> the 
  number of code units used to represent each character.  
  <span class="changed">The UCS-2 encoding form, which is associated with 
  ISO/IEC 10646 and can only express characters in the <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#BMP">BMP</a>, 
  is a fixed width encoding form. In contrast, UTF-16 uses either one or two code
  units and is able to cover the entire code space of Unicode.</span></p>
  <p>UTF-8 provides a good example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The fundamental code unit used for representing character data is 8 bits 
      wide (a byte or <span class="changed">octet</span>). The width map for UTF-8 is:</li>

  <h2>5 <a name="CharacterEncodingScheme">Character Encoding Scheme 
  (CES)</a></h2>
  <p>A <i><span class="changed">simple</span> character encoding scheme</i> 
  is a mapping of <span class="changed">each </span> code unit 
  <span class="changed">of a <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CCS">CCS</a></span> into a<span class="changed"> unique</span>
  serialized byte sequence. </p>
  <p>
    The CES may involve two or more CCSs, and may include code units (e.g. 
      single shifts, SI/SO, or escape sequences) that are not part of the CCS 
      per se, but which are defined by the character encoding architecture and 
      which may require an external registry of particular values (as for the 
      ISO 2022 escape sequences). In such a case, the CES is called a <i>compound 
      CES.</i>
</p>
  <p><span class="changed">Both of these types are commonly referred to 
  as CES.</span> Character encoding schemes are relevant to the 
  issue of cross-platform persistent data involving code units wider than a 
  byte, where byte-swapping may be required to put data into the byte polarity 
  canonical for a particular platform. In particular:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Most fixed-width byte-oriented encoding forms have a trivial mapping 
      into a CES: each 7-bit or 8-bit quantity maps to a byte of the same value.</li>
    <li>Most mixed-width byte-oriented encoding forms also simply serialize the 
      sequence of CC-data-elements to bytes.
      <ul>
        <li>UTF-8, since it is already a byte-oriented encoding form, follows 
          this pattern.</li>
        <li>UTF-16, which involves 16-bit quantities, must specify byte-order 
          for the byte serialization. This is the difference between UTF-16BE, 
          in which the two bytes of the 16-bit quantity are serialized in 
          big-endian order and UTF-16LE, in which they are serialized in 
          little-endian order.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is important not to confuse a <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CEF">CEF</a> and a CES.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CEF">CEF</a> maps code points to code units, while the CES maps code units to 
      bytes. (For a mapping all the way from characters to serialized bytes, see 
      <a href="tr17-3.3.html#CharacterMaps">Section 6 Character Maps</a>.)</li>
    <li>The CES must take into account the byte-order serialization of all code 
      units wider than a byte that are used in the CEF.</li>
    <li>The CES may also make distinctions such as the number of user-defined 
      characters that are allowable. (This applies in particular to the IBM <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CDRA">CDRA</a> 
      architecture, which may distinguish host <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CCSID">CCSID</a>s based on whether the set 
      of <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#UDC">UDC</a>'s is conformably convertible to the corresponding PC code page or 
      not.)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Examples of Character Encoding Schemes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="changed">The Unicode Standard has 7 character encoding schemes: 
      UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32, UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE.</span>
    <li>Unicode 1.1 had three character encoding schemes: UTF-8, UCS-2BE, and 
	UCS-2LE<span class="changed">, although the latter two were not named that way at the time.</span><li>ISO 2022-based charsets (ISO-2022-JP, ISO-2022-KR, etc.), which use 
      embedded escape sequences
    <li><a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#DBCS">DBCS</a> Shift (mix of one single-byte CCS, e.g. <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#JIS">JIS</a> X 0201 and a DBCS CCS, 
      e.g. based on JIS X0208, with a numeric shift of the integer values) For 
      example, Code Page 932 on Windows.
    <li><a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#EUC">EUC</a> (similar to the DBCS Shift encodings, with the application of 
      different numeric shift rules, and the introduction of single-shift bytes: 
      0x8E and 0x8F, that may introduce 3-byte and 4-byte sequences) For 
      example, EUC-JP or EUC-TW on UNIX.
    <li>IBM host mixed code page Asian character sets, which formally mix two 
      distinct CCS's with the SI/SO switching conventions. For example, <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CCSID">CCSID</a> 
      5035 on IBM Japanese host machines.
  </ul>
  <h3><span class="changed">5.1 <a name="ByteOrder">Byte Order</a></span></h3>
  <p><span class="changed">Processor architectures differ in the way that multi-byte 
  machine integers are mapped to storage locations. <i>Little Endian</i> architectures put
  the least significant byte at the lower address, while <i>Big Endian</i> architectures
  start with the most significant byte.</span></p>
  <p><span class="changed">For operations on code units in memory this difference does
  not matter, but when code units are serialized to sequences of bytes using a particular
  <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CES">CES</a>, the byte order becomes important. In terms of reading a data stream, there are two
  types of byte order: <i>Same</i> and <i>Opposite</i> to the byte order of the processor
  reading the data. In the former case, no special operation needs to be taken, in the latter
  case, the data needs to be byte reversed before processing.</span></p>
  <p><span class="changed">In terms of external designation of data streams, three 
  types of byte orders can be distinguished: <i>Big Endian (<a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#BE">BE</a>)</i>, <i>Little Endian (<a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#LE">LE</a>)</i> 
  and <i>default</i> or <i>internally marked</i>.</span></p>
  <p><span class="changed">In Unicode, the characters at code point U+FEFF is defined as the 
  <i>byte order mark</i>, while it's byte-reversed counterpart, U+FFFE is a non-character,
  for <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#UTF">UTF</a>-16, or outside the code space (0xFFFE0000 for UTF-32). At the head of a data stream, 
  the presence of a byte order mark can therefore be used to unambiguously signal the byte 
  order of the code units.</span></p>
  <h2>6 <a name="CharacterMaps">Character Maps</a></h2>
  <p>The mapping from an abstract character repertoire to a serialized sequence 
  of bytes is called a <i>Character Map</i> (CM). A <i>simple character map</i> 
  thus implicitly includes a <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CCS">CCS</a>, a <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CEF">CEF</a>, and a <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CES">CES</a>, mapping from abstract 
  characters to code units to bytes. A <i>compound character map</i> includes a 
  compound CES, and thus includes more than one CCS and CEF. In that case, the 
  abstract character repertoire for the character map is the union of the 
  repertoires covered by the coded character sets involved.</p>
  <p>Character Maps are the things that in the <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#IAB">IAB</a> architecture get <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#IANA">IANA</a> <i>charset</i> 
  identifiers. The important thing, from the IANA charset point of view is that 
  a sequence of encoded characters must be unambiguously mapped onto a sequence 
  of bytes by the charset. The charset must be specified in all instances, as in 
  Internet protocols, where textual content is treated as a ordered sequence of 
  bytes, and where the textual content must be reconstructible from that 
  sequence of bytes.</p>
  <p>Character Maps are also the things that in the IBM <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CDRA">CDRA</a> architecture get 
  <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CCSID">CCSID</a> (coded character set identifier) values. A character map may also be 
  known as a <i>charset</i>, a <i>character set</i>, a <i>code page</i> (broadly 
  construed), or a <i>CHARMAP.</i></p>
  <p>In many cases, the same name is used for both a character map and for a 
  character encoding scheme, such as UTF-16BE. Typically this is done for simple 
  character maps when such usage is clear from context.</p>
  <h2>7 <a name="TransferEncodingSyntax">Transfer Encoding Syntax</a> (TES)</h2>
  <p>A <i>transfer encoding syntax</i> is a reversible transform of encoded <b>data</b> 
  which may (or may not) include textual data represented in one or more 
  character encoding schemes.</p>
  <p>Typically TESs are engineered either to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Avoid particular byte values that would confuse one or more Internet or 
      other transmission/storage protocols: base64, uuencode, BinHex, 
      quoted-printable, etc., or to:
    <li>Formally apply various data compressions to minimize the number of bits 
      to be passed down a communication channel: pkzip, gzip, winzip, etc.
  </ol>
  <p><a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#SCSU">SCSU</a> (and <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#RCSU">RCSU</a>: see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr6/">UTR 
  #6: A Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode</a> [<a href="tr17-3.3.html#SCSU">SCSU</a>]) should also be conceived of 
  as transfer encoding syntaxes. They should not be considered CESs, in part 
  because the compressed forms are not unique, but depend on the sophistication 
  of the compression algorithm.</p>
  <p><span class="changed">Another compression format for Unicode is defined in <a href="../../notes/tn6.1">Unicode Technical 
  Note#6</a>:<i>BOCU-1: <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#MIME">MIME</a>-compatible Unicode 
  Compression</i>. Unlike SCSU, BOCU-1 maps each input string to a unique compressed
  string, but since it does not map each code unit to a unique series of bytes it is not a <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#CES">CES</a>.
  Like BOCU-1, Punycode, defined in [<a href="tr17-3.3.html#RFC3492">RFC3942</a>], is unique only on a 
  string basis and is therefore properly understood as a TES.</span> </p>
  <p>The Internet Content-Transfer-Encoding tags “7bit”&nbsp; and “8bit”&nbsp; are special cases. These are data width specifications 
  relevant basically to mail protocols and which appear to predate true TESs 
  like quoted-printable. Encountering a “7bit”&nbsp; tag does not 
  imply any actual transform of data; it merely is an indication that the 
  charset of the data can be represented in 7 bits, and will pass 7-bit channels 
  — it is really an indication of the encoding form. In contrast, 
  quoted-printable actually does a conversion of various characters (including 
  some <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#ASCII">ASCII</a>) to forms like “=2D” , “=20” , etc., and should 
  be reversed on receipt to regenerate legible text in the designated character 
  encoding scheme.
  <h2>8 <a name="APIBinding">Data Types and API Binding</a></h2>
  <p><span class="changed">Programming languages define specific data types for 
  character data, using bytes or multi-byte code units. For example, the 
  Java char data type always use 16-bit code units, while the size of the char 
  and wchar_t data types in C and C++ are, within quite flexible constraints, 
  implementation defined. In Java, the 16-bit code units are by definition 
  <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#UTF">UTF</a>-16 code units, while in C and C++, the binding to a specific character 
  set is again up to the implementation. In Java, strings are an opaque data 
  type, while in C (and at the lowest level also in C++) they are represented 
  as simple arrays of char or wchar_t.</span></p> 

 <p><span class="changed">The 
  Java model supports portable programs, but external data in other encoding 
  forms must first be converted to UTF-16. The C/C++ model is intended to 
  support a byte serialized character set using the char data type, while 
  supporting a character set with a single code unit per character with the 
  wchar_t data type. These two character sets do not have to be the same, but 
  the repertoire of the larger set must include the smaller set so as to allow 
  mapping from one data type into the other. This allows implementations to 
  support, for example, UTF-8 as the char data type and UTF-32 as the wchar_t 
  data type. In such use, the char data type corresponds to data that is serialized
  for storage and interchange and the wchar_t data type is used for internal
  processing.</span></p> 

 <p><span class="changed">However, the definition of the term <i>character</i>
  in the <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#ISO">ISO</a> C and C++ standard does not necessarily match the definition of abstract
  character in this model. Many widely used libraries and operating systems define wchar_t to be 
  UTF-16 code units. Other <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#API">API</a>s supporting UTF-16 are often simply 
  defined in terms of (arrays of) 16-bit unsigned integers, but this makes 
  certain features of the programming language unavailable, such as string literals.</span></p> 

 <p><span class="changed">When 
  character data types are passed as arguments in APIs, </span>the byte order 
  of the platform is generally not relevant for <span class="changed">code 
  units</span>; the same API can be compiled on platforms with any byte 
  polarity, and will simply expect character data (as for any integral-based 
  data) to be passed to the API in the byte polarity for that platform. <span 
  class="changed">However, the size of the data type must correspond to the 
  size of the code unit, or the results can be unpredictable, as when a byte 
  oriented strcpy is used on UTF-16 data which may contain embedded NUL 
  bytes.</span></p> 

  <p><span class="changed">While there are many API functions 
  that by design do not need to care about which character set the code units 
  correspond to (strlen or strcpy for example), many other operations require 
  information about the character and its properties. As a a result portable 
  programs may not be able to use the char or wchar_t data types in 
  C/C++.</span></p> 

  <h3><span class="changed">8.1 <a name="Strings">Strings</a></span></h3> 
  <p><span class="changed">A string datatype is simply a
  sequence of code units. Thus a Unicode 8-bit string is an sequence of 
  8-bit Unicode code units, a Unicode 16-bit string is an sequence of 16-bit 
  code units, and a Unicode 32-bit string is an sequence of 32-bit code 
  units.</span></p> 

  <p><span class="changed">Depending on the programming environment, a Unicode 
 string may or may not also be required to be in the corresponding Unicode encoding form. For example, strings
in Java, C#, or <a class="charclass" href="tr17-3.3.html#ECMA">ECMA</a>Script are Unicode 16-bit strings, but are not necessarily
well-formed UTF-16 sequences. In normal processing, there are many times where
a string may be in a transient state that is not well-formed UTF-16.
Because strings are such a fundamental component of every program, it can be
far more efficient to postpone checking for well formedness.</span></p> 
  <p><span class="changed">However, whenever strings are specified to be in a particular Unicode
encoding for—even one with the same code unit size—the string must not violate the
requirements of that encoding form. For example, isolated surrogates in a Unicode 16-bit
string are not allowed when that string is specified to be well-formed UTF-16.</span></p>
