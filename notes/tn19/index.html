  <h3><i>Summary</i></h3>
  <p><i><em>This document </em>provides a set of recommendations to linguists 
	who are developing new orthographies.</i></p>
  <h3><i>Status</i></h3>
  <p><i>This document is a <b>Unicode Technical Note</b>. It is supplied purely 
	for informational purposes and publication does not imply any endorsement by 
	the Unicode Consortium. For general information on Unicode Technical Notes, 
	see <a href="../index.html">http://www.unicode.org/notes/</a>.</i></p>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>When linguists and user communities are devising a new orthography for a 
	language—or even trying to come up with a single new character for a 
	phoneme—it is particularly helpful to select new symbols (or letters) that 
	can be used easily on the computer. In this way, written materials can be 
	made available quickly to others in electronic format, such as on web pages 
	or in word processing documents, without the users needing to download 
	special fonts, or have any specialized software. It should be considered a 
	long-term disservice to users to saddle users with an orthography that does 
	not work on today’s computers.</p>
<p>The following suggestions are intended to provide advice on which characters 
will be easier—or more difficult—to implement on computer systems that support 
Unicode, the widely supported international character encoding standard (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/">www.unicode.org</a>). </p>
<p>To get the easiest and quickest access to characters on computers, it is best 
to select from one of the over 96,000 characters already in the Unicode 
Standard. By using the Unicode characters as they were intended, chances are 
good that the devised orthography will be supported in a wide variety of 
off-the-shelf software and displayable with widely available fonts. (However, 
those creating orthographies need to test them out on their computer platforms 
and software before making such decisions; orthographies based on Latin will be 
more generally supported than those that rely on obscure historical scripts.)</p>
<p>By creating an orthography with a completely new character—not in Unicode—the 
chances that the full orthography will be supported in readily available 
software is effectively zero. New characters need to go through a years-long 
process to be standardized, involving meetings with standards committees, 
followed by delays while the characters are incorporated into software and 
fonts. Devising a new orthography means you will not be able to use modern 
technology for it, and you will need to rely on non-standard fonts and software 
while waiting for the international character encoding bureaucrats to get the 
new characters into the international standard. There is also a chance that a 
de-novo character will not be approved for standardization. Hence it is 
advisable—whenever possible—to use a character already encoded, but care must be 
taken in selecting one that is appropriate. </p>
<h3>Recommendations for creating an orthography</h3>
<p>Begin by looking through the code charts in the latest version of the Unicode 
Standard, or in the PDF version on the Unicode Consortium website. Characters in 
Unicode are arranged in blocks of similar characters (code blocks) and are 
listed by block on the Unicode Consortium website (http://www.unicode.org/charts/). 
Be sure to also read the documentation on the particular characters you choose, 
so that they have appropriate semantics. Merely having the correct shape is 
insufficient for making a decision.</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">• </font>If you are using the Latin alphabet, 
rely on characters from Latin blocks (Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement, Latin 
Extended-A, Latin Extended-B, and Latin Extended Additional). IPA symbols can 
also be used (IPA Extensions, the &quot;Phonetic Extensions&quot; block, and Spacing 
Modifier Letters), although these do not necessarily have upper case 
equivalents.</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">• </font>If ASCII characters are used (those 
accessible on most keyboards, including A-Z, a-z, and 0-9 with some common 
punctuation) abide by the character properties assigned to those characters. For 
example, &quot;$&quot; has currency value and using it as a letter will cause problems, 
such as failure in word-selection, parsing difficulties for automated 
processing, inappropriate font-changes, and so forth if it is used as a letter. 
Similarly, selecting a number to be used as a letter will also cause problems.</p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">• </font>Characters based on combinations of a 
base character and combining marks (listed in the Combining Diacritical Marks 
block, <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0300.pdf">
http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0300.pdf</a>) are possible to use, but it is 
best to try to select a combination from commonly available characters. Hundreds 
of pre-composed combinations are available for the Latin script. You can also 
test these, or other, combinations on widely available fonts first (such as 
Doulos SIL, Gentium or Lucida Grande, Arial Unicode MS, and Code2000) and 
transport your experimental texts to different platforms. Note that correct 
placement of a given combining mark may be limited by a given font or 
text-rendering technology.</p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">• </font>Always select a Unicode character with 
the appropriate character properties and semantics, not just the right shape. 
Character properties identify characteristics, such as whether a particular 
character is a letter or a number. The right semantics assure that your 
character will be treated appropriately as an orthographic character, not as a 
punctuation mark or non-letter symbol.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To determine a character&#39;s properties, one of several methods can be used. 
You can check the on-line database (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt">http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt</a>) 
or use a utility program to look up the data for characters of interest, such as 
the free UniBook Character Browser (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/unibook/index.html">http://www.unicode.org/unibook/index.html</a>). 
UniBook has a facility for viewing character properties and displaying charts 
color-coded by categories such as alphabetic, upper-case, etc. Another tool is 
the Unicode Character Properties Excel Workbook by Peter Constable, which is 
available for download at: 
<a href="http://scripts.sil.org/ExcelUnicodeData">
http://scripts.sil.org/ExcelUnicodeData</a>.
</p>
<p>A description of how to read the list of properties is contained in
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UCD.html">Unicode Character 
Database</a>, under the &quot;Property Values&quot; section. For example: Lowercase 
letters are “Ll,” uppercase letters are “Lu.” For further information, please 
consult <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/ch04.pdf">Chapter 
4 of The Unicode Standard 4.0</a>.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Find another character in Unicode that is used in a similar way 
to the one you are working with and look at the encoded character’s properties. 
When in doubt, you can always ask someone, for example by joining the Unicode 
mail list.</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">• </font>If the script you are working with is 
left-to-right, be sure to select a character that is similarly left-to-right or, 
if a letter, neutral. Likewise, an orthography would be very awkward, perhaps 
even impossible to use, if it included letters with different basic 
directionality, such as a mixture of Hebrew and Cyrillic letters.
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">• </font>Strongly avoid the use of characters 
identified as a &quot;presentation form&quot; (i.e., from the Alphabetic Presentation 
Forms and the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks) or &quot;letterlike symbol,&quot; Roman 
numerals (from the &quot;number forms&quot; block), or mathematical operators, or other 
characters that are discouraged or deprecated.
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">• </font>For a punctuation mark, select a 
character from the punctuation block. Using CJK punctuation with a Latin script 
is possible, but the CJK fonts may make them appear extra-wide or extra-narrow.
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">• </font>Avoid selecting a symbol for use as an 
orthographic letter that is part of a pair (such as an opening bracket or 
closing bracket).
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">• </font>For orthographies based on the Latin 
script, before selecting a character from a script other than Latin, carefully 
read:
</p>
<p>(a) the description for the script contained in The Unicode Standard 4.0 or 
later (available online in PDF format from
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/">http://www.unicode.org/versions/</a>). 
The Unicode Standard provides script descriptions by groups: chapter 7 discusses 
the European alphabetic scripts (including the Latin script and its extension, 
the IPA, as well as the Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian and Georgian scripts), Middle 
Eastern scripts are covered in chapter 8, etc. The text will describe any 
special issues that may influence the selection of a given script.
</p>
<p>(b) any annotation to the particular character given in the names list (i.e., 
the notes contained below the name of a character and preceded by a bullet in 
the code charts). Particularly avoid a character whose use is discouraged. The 
annotation describing the use of a character does not limit it from being 
employed in other ways: for example, U+0195 LATIN SMALL LETTER HV appears in 
Gothic transliteration, but it could be adopted in a Native American language 
orthography.</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">• </font>Note that if an unattested character is 
employed only occasionally, users may want to consider changing to a symbol 
already in Unicode rather than having to wait for 2-5 years for a character to 
be approved (if it is approved at all). For example, if a special character 
occasionally is written to represent a glottal stop, other alternative 
characters already in the Unicode Standard could be used. While this may take 
some time of adjustment, the user community will be able to access such an 
alternative immediately.
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">• </font>Avoid the Private Use Area, absolutely. 
This is an area set aside for the private testing of characters, and is never to 
be used for any data that is to be interchanged widely or stored permanently in 
an archive.
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">• </font>Selecting characters from the Basic 
Multilingual Plane (i.e., those in any block whose characters are numbered below 
U+10000) will be easier to use on most currently available computer platforms 
and software. Those scripts listed above &quot;Linear B Syllabary&quot; on the code chart 
page (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/">http://www.unicode.org/charts/</a>) 
are in the BMP. (A list of the scripts contained in the BMP is available at:
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/bmp/">
http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/bmp/</a>.)
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">• </font>Suggestion: Select a character that is 
already widely incorporated in available fonts. If you select characters from a 
wide variety of scripts, it may be more difficult to find a readily available 
font with all the needed glyphs for a given character. A listing of fonts by 
Unicode character range is found on Alan Wood’s website (<a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/fontsbyrange.html#u1e00">http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/fontsbyrange.html#u1e00</a>)
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">• </font>Avoid using all upper-case in a 
Latin-based orthography. All lowercase would be better (because it&#39;s more 
readable and typeable on standard machines and keyboards).
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">• </font>If you devise an orthography based on 
the Arabic script, it is best to use existing characters whenever possible. 
Because the Arabic script model in Unicode contains pre-composed characters with 
various dotting patterns, the invention of a new letter with a unique dotting 
pattern will not be usable with existing software until or unless a new 
character is standardized. Consider choosing a letter that is a fair match for 
the rest of the orthography, and is already encoded, even if that usage is for 
another language or phonetic value.
</p>
<h3>Examples of Good and Bad Practice </h3>
<p>Example 1: Language X has 7 vowels. The creators of the new orthography want 
to stay away from diacritical marks as much as possible, so they use A, E, I, O, 
U, but need two more &quot;vowels&quot;. &quot;Bad practice” would be picking the numerals &quot;6&quot; 
and &quot;7&quot; as the other two vowels, giving: A, E, I, O, U, 6, 7 as &quot;letters&quot; in the 
orthography. Better practice would be to just use an epsilon, open o, rounded 
letters or other base vowels from the extended Latin sets.</p>
<p>Example 2: You have a language with a glottal stop, and you&#39;re using a 
Latin-based orthography. Choosing Arabic &quot;ain&quot; as the character for glottal stop 
would not be advisable. Instead, use one of the various half-rings or other 
letters for glottal stop.</p>
<h3>If no character in Unicode is found</h3>
<p>If a user community is convinced that a particular character is needed and 
missing, or if a particular character has been used widely in print and has been 
clearly typographically differentiated through time, a character proposal may be 
appropriate. A proposal can be written and put forward to the two standards 
committees. To pursue this strategy, first float the proposal on a forum such as 
the Unicode mail list, and then consult the
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/pending/proposals.html">Submitting New 
Characters</a> web page for detailed information on process and current 
proposals.
</p>
<h3>For questions</h3>
<p>For questions on the appropriateness of a character or to determine whether a 
script proposal should be written (or has already been proposed), send a query 
to the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reporting.html">Feedback Form</a> 
(http://www.unicode.org/reporting.html) on the Unicode website, or write to the 
Script Encoding Initiative (<a href="http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/sei">http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/sei</a>), 
a project at UC Berkeley that aims to assist user communities in getting their 
scripts/characters proposed. Another useful resource to consult is the 
“Orthography Development in Relation to Unicode” web page at
