  <h2>1 <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>  
<p>The most popular encoding for Unicode text data exchange is UTF-8. It is  
relatively simple and widely applicable: MIME/email/HTML/XML, in-process use in  
some systems, etc. However, UTF-8 uses more bytes per code point for non-Latin  
scripts than language-specific codepages.</p>  
<p>In some markets where scripts other than Latin are used, the high bytes/code  
point ratio of UTF-8 (and of UTF-16 for scripts other than Latin and CJK  
ideographs) has been criticized and used as a motivation to not use Unicode for  
the exchange of documents in some languages. Larger document sizes are also  
a problem in low-bandwidth environments such as wireless networks for handheld  
systems.</p>  
<p>The Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode [<a href="tn6-2.html#SCSU">SCSU</a>] was created as a Unicode compression scheme with a byte/code point ratio   
similar to language-specific codepages. It has not been widely adopted although   
it fulfills the criteria for an IANA charset and is registered as one. [<a href="tn6-2.html#SCSU">SCSU</a>] is not suitable for MIME  
“text” media types, i.e.,   
it cannot be used directly in emails and similar protocols. [<a href="tn6-2.html#SCSU">SCSU</a>] requires a   
complicated encoder design for good performance.</p>   
<p>BOCU-1 combines the wide applicability of UTF-8 with the compactness of [<a href="tn6-2.html#SCSU">SCSU</a>].   
It is useful for short strings and maintains code point order.</p>   
<h2>2 <a name="Features">Features of BOCU-1</a></h2>    
<h3>2.1 <a name="Compression">Compression</a></h3>   
<p>The byte/code point ratio is 1 for runs of code points from the same block of    
0x80 code points (and for Hiragana), and 2 for runs of CJK Unihan code points, as with [<a href="tn6-2.html#SCSU">SCSU</a>]. The    
startup overhead is very low (similar to [<a href="tn6-2.html#SCSU">SCSU</a>]), which makes it useful for very short strings like    
individual names. The maximum number of bytes per code point is four.</p>    
  <p>With BOCU-1, texts in languages with Latin-based scripts take about the same amount of space as         
  with UTF-8, while texts in all other languages take about 25%-60% less space. Compared to UTF-16,         
  texts in all languages with small character repertoires take approximately half as much space in         
  BOCU-1. For large character sets, i.e., Chinese/Japanese/Korean, texts are about the same size for         
  UTF-16 and BOCU-1.&nbsp;</p>           
<h3>2.2 <a name="Binary_Order">Binary Order</a></h3>           
<p>The lexical order of BOCU-1 bytes is the same    
as the code point order of the original text &mdash; like UTF-8 but unlike [<a href="tn6-2.html#SCSU">SCSU</a>]    
&mdash;    
which allows the compression of large, sorted lists of strings. This makes BOCU-1 suitable for use 
in databases to reduce storage requirements as described above.</p>   
<h3>2.3 <a name="MIME_Compatibility">MIME Compatibility</a></h3>   
<p>The C0 control codes NUL, CR and LF and nine others are encoded with the same    
byte values as in US-ASCII, and those byte values are used <em>only </em>for the    
encoding of these twelve C0 control codes. This makes BOCU-1 suitable for MIME “text” media types, directly usable in emails and generally   
“friendly” for    
ASCII-based tools. The SUB control and its byte value 1A is included in this set    
to avoid problems in DOS/Windows/OS/2 systems where 1A is interpreted as an    
end-of-file marker in text mode.</p>    
    
  <h3>2.4 <a name="Details">Details</a></h3>   
<p>BOCU-1 is byte-oriented and stateful. Its    
inter-character state consists of a single integer. It is deterministic, i.e.,    
the    
same complete input text is always encoded the same way by all encoders (unlike with [<a href="tn6-2.html#SCSU">SCSU</a>]). 
Like [<a href="tn6-2.html#SCSU">SCSU</a>] it can be    
classified as a Character Encoding Scheme (CES) or as a Transfer Encoding Syntax (TES). It is a “charset” according to    
IANA, and it is suitable for    
MIME “text” media types.</p>    
    
<p>The state is reset at each C0 control (U+0000..U+001F, includes CR, LF, TAB). CRLF-separated lines do not affect each  
other’s encoding. Together with BOCU-1    
being deterministic, this allows line-based file comparisons (diff) and makes BOCU-1 usable    
with RCS, CVS and other source-code control systems (unlike [<a href="tn6-2.html#SCSU">SCSU</a>]). This also allows some    
limited random access.</p>    
    
<p>Byte values for single-byte codes and lead bytes overlap with trail bytes.    
So unlike UTF-8, character boundaries cannot be determined in random access, except    
by backing up to a reset point. Byte values 7F..9F (DEL and C1 control codes) are used as lead and trail bytes. 
US-ASCII characters (code points U+0021..U+007E) are not encoded with the    
same bytes as in US-ASCII. Therefore, the charset must be specified with a    
signature byte sequence or in a higher-level protocol.</p>    
    
  <p>As a single/lead byte, byte value FF is used as a special “reset-state-only” command.    
It does not encode any code point. FF is also a normal trail byte. Having a “reset only” command allows simple concatenation of BOCU-1 byte streams.    
(All other BOCU-1 byte sequences would append some code point.)    
<em>Using FF to reset the state breaks the ordering!    
The use of FF resets is discouraged.</em> Byte stream concatenation without resetting with FF requires to scan back to    
a C0 control whose byte value is not used for trail bytes    
(last known reset to initial state);    
then decode to the end of the first stream and encode the first non-U+0020 code point    
of the second stream according to the current state;    
then append the rest of the second stream.    
The same procedure could be used to remove an FF reset command.</p>    
    
<h2>3 <a name="Signature">Signature Byte Sequence</a></h2>   
<p>An initial U+FEFF is encoded in BOCU-1 with the three bytes FB EE 28.</p>   
   
<h2>4 <a name="Algorithm">Encoding Algorithm</a></h2>   
<p>The basic algorithm is as described in <a href="http://icu.sourceforge.net/docs/papers/binary_ordered_compression_for_unicode.html">Binary    
Ordered Compression for Unicode</a> [<a href="tn6-2.html#BOCU">BOCU</a>].</p>   
<p>BOCU-1 differs from the generic algorithm by using a different set of byte   
value ranges and by encoding U+0000..U+0020 directly with byte values 00..20. In   
addition, the space character U+0020 does not affect the state. This is to avoid large difference values at the beginning and end of   
each word.</p>   
<p>Partial pseudo-code for a per-code point encoding function is as follows:</p>   
<pre>encode(int &amp;prev, int c) {
    if(c&lt;=0x20) {
        output (byte)c;
        if(c!=0x20) {
            prev=0x40;
        }
    } else {
        int diff=c-prev;
        // encode diff in 1..4 bytes and output them

        // adjust prev
        if(c is Hiragana) {
            prev=middle of Hiragana;
        } else if(c is CJK Unihan) {
            prev=middle of CJK Unihan;
        } else if(c is Hangul) {
            prev=middle of Hangul;
        } else {
            prev=(c&amp;~0x7f)+0x40;
        }
    }
}
</pre>   
<h2>5 <a name="Sample_Code">Sample C Code</a></h2>   
<p>The sample C code serves as the full specification of   
BOCU-1. Every conformant encoder and decoder must generate equivalent output and   
detect any illegal input code points and illegal input byte sequences. Recovery   
from illegal input is not specified. Single surrogates are encoded if present in   
the input (e.g., unmatched single surrogate code units in UTF-16). Proper input   
of supplementary code points (e.g., matched surrogate pairs in UTF-16) must be   
encoded by code points.</p>   
   
  <p>This code uses <a href="http://ibm.com/software/globalization/icu">International Components for Unicode</a>    
  [<a href="tn6-2.html#ICU">ICU</a>] standard    
headers and the one implementation file <code>icu/source/common/utf_impl.c</code>.    
(It is not necessary to link the entire [<a href="tn6-2.html#ICU">ICU</a>] common library.) This is for    
convenience in the surrounding test functions and not necessary for the core    
BOCU-1 functions. These headers and implementation file provide the following:</p>    
    
<ul>    
  <li>Include inttypes.h or define its types.</li>    
  <li>Define UChar for UTF-16 as an unsigned 16-bit type (wchar_t or uint16_t).</li>    
  <li>Define UTF* macros to handle reading and writing of in-process UTF-8/16    
    strings.</li>    
</ul>

<p>A complete, compiled sample <a href="bocu1.exe">executable for Windows&reg;</a>        
from this source code is available for download. Aside from basic implementation        
and consistency tests, this also provides file conversion between UTF-8 and        
BOCU-1. Use a command-line argument of “?” or “-h” for        
usage.</p>    
    
  <h2>6 <a name="Performance">BOCU-1 Performance</a></h2>   
  <p>This is a performance comparison between BOCU-1,    
    UTF-8, and [<a href="tn6-2.html#SCSU">SCSU</a>] when implemented as [<a href="tn6-2.html#ICU">ICU</a>] converters,    
    which convert to and from UTF-16. The time is for roundtrip conversions from the internal UTF-16 form to the encoding and back. 
  Values are relative to UTF-8.</p>
