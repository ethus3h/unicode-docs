<h2 align="center">A General Method for Rendering Combining Marks</h2>


<p>In any implementation of textual rendering with Unicode characters, the  
problem of placing arbitrary combining marks, typically accents and diacritical 
marks, inevitably arises. This  
problem has often been thought of as a difficult one to solve. Some  
implementations simply don't face the problem, and will render only  
pre-composed glyphs for pre-composed characters, or in other words, retain  
the one-to-one character to glyph processing model of older TTY style  
implementations. Other implementations are willing to look up combinations  
of base characters and combining marks, and render the combination only if  
a pre-composed glyph for the combination occurs in the font.
</p>
<p>
For a wide variety of combinations of base character augmented by an  
arbitrary number of combining marks of several types, it is actually not  
difficult to render a legible combination even in the absence of specific  
metrics pertaining to each glyph. For many purposes such an approach yields  
results that are quite acceptable, even if not a perfect typographical  
solution. Typographers may cringe, but the method gets results that are  
more useful than nothing.
</p>
<p>
The remainder of this paper discusses a general method for rendering any  
combination of one or more combining marks with respect to any base  
character. This approach is quite useful for a variety of scripts,  
including the following: Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, Georgian, IPA,  
Letterlike Symbols, Dingbats, Cherokee, Runic, and even Chinese characters.  
The combining marks for which this method is useful include nearly all  
of the Latin-derived combining marks in the U+0300 block as well as many  
script-specific characters, such as nuktas (for example, 
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">U+0A3C GURMUKHI  
SIGN NUKTA</span>). Furthermore, this method can be used with scripts such as  
Tibetan as a fall-back mechanism for arbitrary stacking in the absence of  
good metrics for particular combinations.
</p>
<p>
Most combining marks are centered horizontally with respect to the  
character they are placed upon. The acute accent and umlaut are two common  
examples. This method primarily treats this type of mark, but can be  
extended to marks that are not centered by applying slight modifications.
</p>
<p>
Most combining marks fall into two very general classes with respect to their  
placement: those that are above the character and those that are below.  
Each of these classes can likewise be one of two sub-classes: those that  
are attached to the base character -- such as the cedilla -- and those that  
are detached from the base character -- such as the umlaut. In all, we  
have four major classes:
</p>

  <td class="noborder">acute</td>
  <td class="noborder" style="text-align: center">230</td></tr>
<tr><td class="noborder">above the base character, attached</td>
  <td class="noborder">(no examples)&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="noborder" style="text-align: center">214</td></tr>
<tr><td class="noborder">below the base character, detached</td>
  <td class="noborder">cedilla</td>
  <td class="noborder" style="text-align: center">220</td></tr>
<tr><td class="noborder">below the base character, attached</td>
  <td class="noborder">dot-below</td>
  <td class="noborder" style="text-align: center">202</td></tr>
</table></center>
<p>
Chapter 4 of the Unicode Standard contains an exhaustive table of combining 
marks and makes finer distinctions among types, but for our  
purposes, these suffice to show the general principles of the method.
</p>
<p>
Most scripts to which the common combining marks apply are alphabetic  
scripts of the bi-cameral type. Some, like Cherokee, are uni-cameral. In  
their traditional type designs, nearly all of them have the concept of the  
"capital height" for majuscule letters, and an "x-height" or minuscule  
letter ascent. This method makes use of the capital height, or "cap-height"  
as a basic unit of measurement.
</p>
<p>
Each glyph in a font has a bounding rectangle -- the smallest rectangle  
that completely encloses the outline of the glyph. Each glyph also has an  
advance width. This is usually just called "width" and is separate from,  
and usually wider than, a glyph's bounding rectangle.
</p>
<p>
The general method of placing a combining mark with respect to a base is  
to horizontally center the mark, then to place it above or below the base,  
with or without a "gap" between the character depending on the mark's  
type. The difficulties usually encountered in actually performing such a  
simply stated task are (A) calculation of a relation between the bounding  
rectangles of the glyphs, and (B) calculation of the "gap" between  
characters and detached combining marks.
</p>
<p>
All modern application platforms have means of querying fonts for various  
properties for each of the glyphs. This information always includes a  
bounding rectangle and a width, at least. Other metrics and various tables  
may be available in some fonts, but not all. We will rely only on knowing  
the bounding rectangle and width of each glyph, and the cap-height of the  
font.
</p>
<p>
Assume that we have a stream of glyphs which has been generated from a  
character stream. Assume those glyphs have already been "rationalized" such  
that for character combinations involving combining marks for which  
pre-composed glyphs exist, the pre-composed glyphs are already present in  
the stream. Thus, the only glyphs left in the stream which need to be combined are those  
for which no pre-composed glyph is present in the font. (The glyphs may be  
from different fonts as well.) The remainder of this discussion ignores the  
font parameter; it is understood to be present, but is omitted for clarity.
</p>
<p>
This method renders the bounding rectangle of the combining mark glyphs  
relative to the bounding rectangle of a base glyph, or a dynamically  
calculated base unit consisting of a base glyph and previous combining  
mark glyphs within the stream.
</p>
<p>
Assumptions of the algorithm:

</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For each glyph the following information is known:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>the character the glyph represents (if any): repChar;</li>
      <li>the numerical value and/or name of the glyph itself: theGlyph;</li>
      <li>the glyph's zero-based bounding rectangle : ...Rect;</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The current font has per-glyph metrics, as well as overall metrics,
such as CapHeight.</li>
    <li>The movement direction through the glyphs is left-to-right, horizontally.</li>
  </ul>
<p>
Assume that the base character is to be rendered at the origin point on  
Cartesian plane. The bounding rectangle of this and all other glyphs is  
relative to (0,0). Our example deals with Postscript fonts, which usually  
have associated metric information in a form like this (for the standard  
Adobe Times-Roman font):
</p>
<pre>	...
	FontBBox -168 -218 1000 898
	CapHeight 662
	...
	C 69 ; WX 611 ; N E ; B 12 0 597 662 ;
	C 81 ; WX 722 ; N Q ; B 34 -178 701 676 ;
	C 199 ; WX 333 ; N dotaccent ; B 118 523 216 623 ;
	C 200 ; WX 333 ; N dieresis ; B 18 523 315 623 ;
	C 202 ; WX 333 ; N ring ; B 67 512 266 711 ;
	C 203 ; WX 333 ; N cedilla ; B 52 -215 261 0 ;
	...
</pre>
<p>
Postscript "bounding boxes" are given in terms of two points, the lower  
left and upper right. We convert these to "rectangles" expressed in terms  
of origin and size. The bounding rectangles for the glyphs in the example  
above are:
</p>
<pre>	Times-Roman bounding rects = (x, y, w, h)
	E rect = (12, 0, 585, 662)
	Q rect = (34, -178, 667, 854)
	Diaeresis rect = (18, 523, 297, 100)
	Ring rect = (67, 512, 259, 100)
	Cedilla rect = (52, -215, 209, 215)
</pre>
<p>
For any of the combining marks under discussion, the X coordinate at  
which they are to be rendered is calculated as follows:
</p>
<pre>	Xpoint = (BaseRect.x - MarkRect.x) + ((BaseRect.w - MarkRect.w) / 2);
</pre>
<p>
The Y coordinate depends on whether the mark is above or below the base  
glyph, and in either case is calculated as follows:
</p>
<pre>	if (<i>the mark is above the base</i>) {
	    Ypoint = ((BaseRect.y + BaseRect.h) + TheGap) - MarkRect.y;
	} else {
	    Ypoint = BaseRect.y - MarkRect.y - MarkRect.h - TheGap;
	}
</pre>
<p>
You may ask how the gap is calculated. This is a heuristic measurement,  
but for most purposes I have found that a gap of 1/8 the cap-height of a  
font is fairly reasonable and yields good results across a great variety of  
fonts. (For vertically stretched fonts, a smaller value such as 1/10 might  
be appropriate. If no cap-height measurement is available, a value of 1/12 the 
em-square might be appropriate, as cap-heigh generally varies from about 65% to 
70% of the em-square.) For purposes of calculation, the above formula always  
includes the variable "TheGap", but in each case this should be calculated  
depending on whether the mark is attached or not, as follows:
</p>
<pre>	if (<i>the mark is detached from the base</i>) {
	    TheGap = (CapHeight / 8);
	} else {
	    TheGap = 0;
	}
</pre>
<p>
In processing, as each combining mark is encountered in turn, the  
algorithm calculates the bounding rectangle of the <i>entire</i> combination that  
has just been rendered, and renders the next combining mark glyph relative to  
that rectangle. That is, for each combination of base glyph with all of its  
combining marks, perform the following steps:
</p>
<pre>	combination_bounding_rect = base_bounding_rect;
	display the base glyph at (0,0);
	while (<i>more marks</i>) {
	    display the mark relative to combination_bounding_rect;
	    increase combination_bounding_rect by
			the extent of mark_bounding_rect;
	}
	move horizontally by the width of the base glyph;
</pre>

<h3>
<b>Pseudo-C</b></h3>
<p>
This is a C-like pseudo-code implementation of the algorithm  
for an entire stream of glyphs. The main loop runs through a stream, and  
for each sequence of base and combining marks, loops over the combining marks while calculating the increased bounding rectangle of each  
additional mark.</p>
<h3>
<b>Perl</b></h3>
<p>
This is an implementation in Perl with the loop &quot;unrolled&quot; into a sequence of 
steps. The output of this program yields a Postscript program which, if rendered 
to a Postscript printer, produces a picture of the letter &quot;E&quot; with various 
combining marks attached to it. At each step along the way, a gray box is 
drawn around the component, and as the increasing bounding rectangles are 
calculated, they are likewise outlined in gray. The result of an application 
looks like the figure below (first with, then without surrounding boxes):</p>
<center>
<table class="noborder" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td class="noborder"><img border="0" src="e-withboxes.jpg" width="99" height="240"></td>
<td class="noborder"><img border="0" src="e-withoutboxes.jpg" width="107" height="245"></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>
<p>
A comparison of that result with the precomposed glyph for <i>capital E with  
dieresis</i> in the same font is shown below:
</p>
<center><p>
	<img border="0" src="e-comparison.jpg" width="201" height="240">
	</p>
</center>
<h3>
<b>Italics</b></h3>
<p>
A further refinement of this algorithm deals somewhat intelligently with  
placement of combining marks in italic fonts. It can be easily verified  
that if the above algorithm is applied to italics, the result looks  
visually awkward because the marks are not placed visually with respect to  
the italic angle, but with the bounding rectangle. Ideally, the marks would  
be moved slightly to the right by an amount dependent on the italic angle  
of the base glyph's font and the height of the mark above the base glyph.  
The diagrams below illustrate the following discussion.</p>
<center>
<table class="noborder" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td class="noborder"><img border="0" src="figure-m-italic.jpg" width="188" height="189"></td>
<td class="noborder">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td class="noborder"><img border="0" src="figure-triangle.jpg" width="156" height="237"></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
As a trivial example, consider placing an umlaut over the Latin lower-case  
"m". The italic angle of the font is "alpha" degrees, and the base of the  
umlaut is at height <b>b</b> above the baseline. The horizontal adjustment  
required to visually center the umlaut is length <b>a</b>, as shown in the 
triangle diagram above.</p>
<p>
The distance <b>a</b> which the umlaut must be moved rightward is <b>c × sin α</b>. To find that, first solve for <b>c</b>,  the distance  
from P1 to P2, where P1 is the origin of the base bounding rectangle and P2  
is the lower left corner of the umlaut glyph. The formulae follow:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="figure-equations.jpg" width="459" height="96">
</p>
<p>
In the italic case, before  
rendering the umlaut with the method above, simply calculate <b>a</b> and add it  
to the result as follows:
</p>
<pre>	Xpoint = (BaseRect.x - MarkRect.x) + ((BaseRect.w - MarkRect.w) / 2.0);
	if (the font is italic) {
	    // calculate a with respect to italic angle
	    Xpoint += a;
	}
</pre>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400">Both Truetype and Postscript fonts contain a 
metric for the italic angle from which the angle </span> <b>α</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> 
can be derived.</span></p>

<h3>
Summary</h3>

<p>
The methods outlined here work  well with a variety of fonts, many  
scripts, and most combining marks. It is particularly well-suited to application 
with simple alphabetic scripts and characters in the U+0300 block. An actual implementation for production use  
would of course include specific reference to fonts and other details.</p>

<p>
Because there are a variety of combining marks that are placed in positions 
other than horizontally centered, an actual implementation would probably 
account for these by modifications of the centering algorithm presented above.</p>
