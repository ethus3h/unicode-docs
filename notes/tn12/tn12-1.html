  <h3><i>Summary</i></h3>
  <p><i>This document attempts to make the case that it is advantageous to use  
    UTF-16 (or 16-bit 
    Unicode strings) for text processing. It is most important to use Unicode rather than  
    older approaches to text encoding, but beyond that it  
    simplifies software development even further to use the same internal form for text  
    representation everywhere. UTF-16 is already the dominant processing  
    form and therefore provides advantages.</i></p>

  <p><i>Unless the distinction is particularly important, I use the term “UTF-x” 
    to mean “UTF-x or x-bit Unicode strings” for brevity, and because “UTF-x” is the older and more familiar term compared with 
  “x-bit 
    Unicode strings” [<a href="tn12-1.html#U4ch2">U4ch2</a>].</i></p>

  <h2>1 <a name="Unicode_Processing">Unicode for Processing</a></h2>
  <p>More important than the question of the preferred form of Unicode is to use Unicode at all: The 
    most important lesson of several decades of handling text in software is to use 
    a single, universal coded character set. Originally, a single legacy character 
    set was assumed, which limited software to single markets. The POSIX model of 
    character set agnosticism was an improvement but made it hard to optimize for 
    efficient text processing, and nearly impossible to handle truly multilingual 
    documents or server data. Switching between different processing charsets 
    requires specific text handling functions and character properties databases for 
    each supported charset. Direct programming for Unicode allows to develop and 
    use optimized libraries and also to hardcode critical paths without restricting 
    the reach of the software.</p> 

  <p><i>Important: </i>There are multiple encoding forms for  
  Unicode. The standard [<a href="tn12-1.html#U4ch2">U4ch2</a>] defines the UTF-8, UTF-16 and  
  UTF-32 encoding forms for processing (as well as related encoding schemes  
  for data exchange). It also defines 8/16/32-bit Unicode strings that are  
  simply vectors of UTF-8/16/32 code units, i.e., such strings need not contain  
  well-formed UTF-8/16/32 sequences during processing. <i>All of these <u>are</u> Unicode.  
  They are simply different ways to deal with the <u>same</u> character set and 
  repertoire in software. All of them <u>work</u>.</i></p> 

  <p>For a good overview and illustration of the Unicode   
  character model and encoding forms see <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/docs/papers/forms_of_unicode/">Forms    
  of Unicode</a>  [<a href="tn12-1.html#Forms_Unicode">FormsU</a>].</p>  

  <p>The following sections briefly compare the Unicode encoding 
  forms for processing, but the main argument of this document is that 
  consistent use of the same form simplifies the development of software and 
  related standards.</p> 

  <h2>2 <a name="Optimized_16">Unicode is Optimized for 16 Bits</a></h2>
  <p>The original Unicode design was for a fixed-width 16-bit encoding. Unicode  
    2.0 extended the architecture, and later Unicode versions assigned supplementary  
    characters, in a way that is designed to maintain high performance with 16-bit  
    processing. (See for example “International Programming with Unicode  
  Surrogates” [<a href="tn12-1.html#Programming_Surrogates">ProgSurr</a>].)</p>

  <p>The optimization for 16-bit units consists mainly in the assignment of all commonly 
    used characters and format controls on the BMP, reachable with one 16-bit unit. 
    Therefore, supplementary code points are very 
    rare in most text.</p> 

  <p><i>Important: </i>Supplementary code points must be    
  supported for full Unicode support, regardless of the encoding form. Many characters are assigned supplementary    
  code points, and even whole scripts are entirely encoded    
  outside of the BMP. The opportunity for optimization of 16-bit Unicode string    
  processing is that the <u> most commonly used</u> characters are stored with single    
  16-bit code units, so that it is useful to concentrate performance work on    
  code paths for them, while also maintaining support and reasonable performance    
  for supplementary code points.</p>   

  <p>From a programming point of view it reduces the need for error handling that 
    there are no invalid 16-bit words in 16-bit Unicode strings. By contrast, there are 
    code unit values that are invalid in 8/32-bit Unicode strings. All pairs of 
    lead/trail surrogates in UTF-16 represent valid supplementary code points, and 
    reading 16-bit Unicode requires to look ahead at most one unit.</p> 

  <p>Adapting existing software — where 8-bit strings were                       
  used — to 16-bit Unicode strings requires to add or modify APIs. On the                       
  other hand, good Unicode support requires at least a review of legacy code,                       
  and often modifications to eliminate limiting assumptions. A different string                       
  type for Unicode actually provides a useful demarcation between codepage-agnostic                       
  and Unicode-aware parts of software.&nbsp;</p>                      

  <h2>3 <a name="UTF8">UTF-8: Good for Compatibility</a></h2>                      
  <p>UTF-8 was mainly designed to store Unicode filenames in an ASCII-friendly
    way. It is suitable for processing, but it is significantly more complex to
    process than UTF-16. Lead bytes have a relatively complex encoding, and up to three trail
    bytes (or five to cope with the original definition) must be counted, read and
    range-checked, then the resulting code point must be range-checked as well. (It
    is possible to create a controlled environment where input strings are checked
    for correct UTF-8 encoding and string operations guarantee to maintain it; only
    in such an environment can a different set of processing functions be optimized
    to avoid the per-byte error checking.)</p>

  <p>UTF-8 is often preferred for storage and data exchange, removing a conversion step if it is
    also used for processing. However, Unicode software almost always interfaces
    with legacy applications and data and needs to be prepared for conversion
    anyway. UTF-8 stores Latin text in a compact form compared to UTF-16 but does
    not provide any advantages for other scripts or even uses more space. There are other Unicode charsets
    (for example, SCSU and BOCU-1) that are more efficient for storage
    and data exchange.</p>

  <p>UTF-8 can be necessary to move Unicode strings through existing “agnostic” or only ASCII-aware APIs. On the other hand, programming 
    for Windows has shown that separate APIs with a different text data type provide 
    an easy way to separate legacy encoding data from Unicode and make it obvious 
    where conversions are needed.</p> 

  <p>Conventional wisdom suggests that Unix/Linux software always uses UTF-8 for 
    Unicode processing (or UTF-32 with wchar_t), but the <a href="tn12-1.html#Software_16"> list</a> below shows 
    that software with good Unicode support tends to use UTF-16 even there.</p> 

  <h2>4 <a name="UTF32">UTF-32: Too Much Memory, Too Little Advantage</a></h2>
  <p>UTF-32 has a trivial structure, but half of the memory usage and bandwidth is
    wasted, which decreases performance.</p>

  <p>Fixed-width processing for all code points including supplementary ones is good for very low-level algorithms, but multi-code 
    point strings must be treated as units in many cases in order to deal with “user characters”. UTF-16 already allows fixed-width processing of BMP 
    characters.</p>

  <h2>5 <a name="Consistency">Consistency is Best</a></h2>
  <p>For software development it is best to use the same internal form everywhere to avoid conversion. Conversion 
    among UTFs is fast and reliable, but still takes some time and code. Conversion 
    also needs to extend beyond the string representation itself to string indexes, 
    offsets and lengths, which can be visible across a protocol (e.g., SQL) or a 
    software boundary (e.g., Java/JNI).</p>

  <p>Another potential problem is that while 
    conversion between UTFs is lossless, conversion between 8/16/32-bit Unicode 
    strings which are not well-formed UTF-8/16/32 strings is not defined. (See 
  Encoding Forms and Unicode Strings in Unicode 4 chapter 2 [<a href="tn12-1.html#U4ch2">U4ch2</a>].) This means that strings 
    would have to be well-formed at internal encoding form boundaries, instead of 
    only at system boundaries to the outside. (For this reason, there have been 
    proposals to standardize the conversion of malformed Unicode strings, especially 
    between 8-bit and 16-bit Unicode.)</p> 

  <p>Using the same form of Unicode results in seamless text handling without any 
    conversions of strings or associated indexes. It simplifies the development and 
    use of libraries and other reusable code and avoids the development of complex 
    algorithms multiple times, each optimized for a different encoding form.</p> 

  <h2>6 <a name="Software_16">Software Using UTF-16</a></h2>

  <p>Most major software with good Unicode support uses UTF-16 (or 16-bit Unicode strings). Note that  
    much of the software listed below runs on Unix/Linux systems as well as Windows  
    and others.</p>  

  <ul>

        <li>Enterprise Cobol [<a href="tn12-1.html#Cobol">Cobol</a>]</li> 
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The programming languages above support Unicode strings as 
  part of the language and its standard functions. While an ISO Technical Report 
  is being prepared for 16/32-bit string data types and string literals in C [<a href="tn12-1.html#ISO19769">ISO19769</a>], 
  use of Unicode strings additionally requires Unicode libraries like [<a href="tn12-1.html#ICU">ICU</a>].

  <p>Of course, there are also examples for software that supports Unicode and
    uses UTF-8 and/or UTF-32 internally, sometimes even with good Unicode support,
    like Perl.</p>

  <h2>7 <a name="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
  <p>Unicode is the best way to process and store text. While there are several  
    forms of Unicode that are suitable for processing, it is best to use the same  
    form everywhere in a system, and to use UTF-16 in particular for  
  two reasons:</p> 

  <ol>
    <li>The vast majority of characters (by frequency of use) are on the BMP.</li>
    <li>For seamless integration with the 
    majority of existing software with good Unicode support.</li> 
  </ol>
