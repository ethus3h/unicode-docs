<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this document we list all Unicode character 
	names with known clerical errors in the spelling of their names at the time 
of its writing. In addition, we have compiled 
information on many misnamed characters, misleading character 
	names, and characters with other known problems with their names. </p>
<p>Because Unicode Standard is a <i>character encoding
standard</i> and not the <i>Universal Encyclopedia of Writing
Systems and Character Identity</i>, the <i>stability</i> and <i>uniqueness
</i>of published character names is far more important than the correctness of 
the name. The published character names are <i>normative</i> for the purposes of the
Unicode standard and the large number of other IT standards that
reference it. These standards require stable identifiers and character names must 
therefore be <i>immutable </i>— any change of character names is almost
as disruptive of the standards as changing code points for
characters would be. Accordingly, the Unicode Consortium has adopted the
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/policies/stability_policy.html#Name">Name Stability Policy</a>, 
preventing changes in character names. As a result, errors in character names 
cannot be corrected. Instead, important character name anomalies anomalies are 
documented with annotations in the
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/">Unicode Character Code Charts</a>.</p>

<p>The requirement for a unique and stable character name that can be used as a 
formal identifier does <i>not</i> mean that the Unicode Standard dictates to
anyone what the name of any given letter in their writing system
should properly be, whether in English or in any other language. The Unicode 
Code Charts provide informative aliases for a large number of characters, the 
names of which are not anomalous or defective. This is because different user 
communities often use different names for the same character, even in English.
</p>
<p>One of the reasons why the Unicode standard publishes many
informative aliases in the Unicode names list is because there often are
much better, more communicative names for particular characters, <i>even in English</i> than the normative names in the data file. 
For example, U+002F SOLIDUS is more widely known among its American users as <i>
slash.</i> Informal aliases are useful in describing a character, but cannot be 
used as identifiers, because they are not guaranteed to be unique or stable. Users are free 
to use such aliases and other names, as long as they are not mis-represented as corrections
<i>to</i> the standard, but instead used as alternative, more useful
names for characters <i>in</i> the standard.</p>
<p>For character names that were encoded with misspelled words as part of their 
name, or that exhibit other serious errors, 
	The Unicode Standard has adopted normative character name aliases. These aliases can be used as a 
	alternative, normative identifier for the character without the need to preserve 
the original spelling or other error in the character name. While this 
means that some characters can have more than one identifier, each identifier 
continues to uniquely refer to a single character. Formal aliases are documented 
in the NameAliases.txt file in the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/ucd/">Unicode 
	Character Database</a>. Formal name aliases also documented in 
	the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/"> 
Unicode Code Charts</a>. We have not documented them here, instead, we merely 
indicate for which characters formal aliases exist at the time of this writing.</p>
<p>In some cases, annotations have been added to the names list in the Unicode 
Standard to document various lesser problems, but to date there has been no full 
listing of all known problems.</p>
	<p>The authors therefore intend this Technical Note to serve as a convenient summary of the information about character 
	name anomalies in the Unicode Standard at the time of its writing. It will be updated from 
time to time as additional anomalies become known. While the information in this 
	technical note is based on information published in the Unicode Standard, 
	the selection and manner of presentation in this document reflect choices 
	made by its authors; it does not in any way supersede the information in the 
	Unicode Standard.</p>

<h2>List of Known Anomalies and Explanations</h2>
<p>This section lists character names with known anomalies, including those for 
which a formal alias has been defined. It 
	provides further information about some names that have been the objects of 
	discussion or inquiry. As issues are reported, additional entries may be 
	added at any time and without notice. While many of the explanations below 
are based on annotations in the Unicode Code charts, they have been edited or 
re-stated by the authors.</p>

<!-- Start List -->

	<p>U+0149 LATIN SMALL LETTER N PRECEDED BY APOSTROPHE</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>Even though this is encoded as single character, it is not usually 
		considered a single <i>letter</i>.</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>U+01A2 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER <font color="#FF0000"><b>OI</b></font><br>
	U+01A3 LATIN SMALL LETTER <font color="#FF0000"><b>OI</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>These should have been called letter GHA. They are neither 
			pronounced &#39;oi&#39; nor based on the letters &#39;o&#39; and &#39;i&#39;.
			Formal aliases correcting these to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER GHA and
			LATIN SMALL LETTER GHA have been defined.</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>U+01BE LATIN LETTER INVERTED GLOTTAL STOP WITH STROKE</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>This is actually based on a ligation of &quot;ts&quot;, not an inverted glottal stop.</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>U+0238 LATIN SMALL LETTER DB DIGRAPH<br>U+0239 LATIN SMALL LETTER QP DIGRAPH</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>These are actually ligatures, rather than digraphs</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>U+025B LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN E</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>This is actually a <i>Latin epsilon</i> and should have 
			been so called.</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>U+025E LATIN SMALL LETTER CLOSED REVERSED OPEN E</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>Actually a <i>closed reversed epsilon</i> (reversed form of U+025B). 
		</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>U+0285 LATIN SMALL LETTER SQUAT REVERSED ESH</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>This is actually a <i>reversed fishhook r with retroflex hook</i>.</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>U+02C7 CARON<br>U+030C COMBINING CARON</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>The &quot;caron&quot; should have been called <i>hacek</i> and <i>
		combining hacek</i>. The term &quot;caron&quot; 
			is suspected by some to be an invention of some early standards 
			body, but it has also been claimed by others to have been in use at Linotype before the days of digital 
			typography. Its true origin may be lost in the mists of time.</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>U+034F COMBINING GRAPHEME JOINER</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>The name does not describe the function of this character. Despite its name, it does not join graphemes. 
		For more infomation, see Section 7.9 <i>Combining Marks,</i> of the 
		Unicode Standard. </li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>U+039B GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA<br>
U+03BB GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>The use of the spelling <i>lamda</i> derives from ISO 10646. This 
		does not mean that it 
		is more correct than <i>lambda</i>, merely that the spelling without the &#39;b&#39; is 
		the one used in the formal character names.</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>U+04A5 CYRILLIC SMALL LIGATURE EN GHE<br>
U+04B5 CYRILLIC SMALL LIGATURE TE TSE<br>
U+04D5 CYRILLIC SMALL LIGATURE A IE</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>Despite their names, these are not decomposable ligatures.</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>U+0598 HEBREW ACCENT ZARQA</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>Perhaps should have been called <i>Hebrew accent tsinnorit</i>. May also be used for zarqa when shown on accented non-final letter. See
		<a href="tn27-2.html#Appendix_A">Appendix A</a>.</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>U+05AE HEBREW ACCENT ZINOR</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>Should have been called <i>Hebrew accent zarqa</i> (= <i>tsinor</i>). 
			See <a href="tn27-2.html#Appendix_A">Appendix A</a>.</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>U+0670 ARABIC LETTER SUPERSCRIPT ALEF</p>

	U+06D3 ARABIC LETTER YEH BARREE WITH HAMZA ABOVE</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>These would have been better named as ligatures.</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>U+0709 SYRIAC SUBLINEAR COLON SKEWED <font color="#FF0000"><b>RIGHT</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>The direction of the skewing was misinterpreted when the
			character was named. It should have been "... SKEWED LEFT". 
		A formal alias correcting this error has been defined.</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>U+0964 DEVANAGARI DANDA<br>
U+0965 DEVANAGARI DOUBLE DANDA</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>Despite the fact that these characters have &quot;DEVANAGARI&quot; in their 
		names, these punctuation marks are intended for common use for the 
		scripts of India.</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>U+0A01 GURMUKHI ADAK BINDI </p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>The spelling of the word Adak with a single &#39;d&#39; is inconsistent 
			with U+0A71 GURMUKHI ADDAK and should really have had two d&#39;s.
		</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>U+0B83 TAMIL SIGN VISARGA</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>This character is actually the <i>aaytham</i>, and is not used as a visarga in Tamil.</li>

<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>This character is not a delimiter, but is a non-breaking version of the tsheg mark (U+0F0B) that is used exclusively between the letter NGA (U+0F44) and the shad mark (U+0F0D).</li>

<h2><a name="Appendix_A" href="tn27-2.html#Appendix_A">Appendix A: Notes on Zarqa and Zinor</a></h2>
<p>There are two separate
    cantillation systems in the Hebrew Bible. One is
    used for Psalms, Proverbs and (most of) Job, (the "poetic" books, hence
    the "poetic system"), and the other is used everywhere else. The two systems
    have structural similarities and share some graphemes, but not all.
    In modern printing the accents have roughly the same shape; old manuscripts actually had them written slightly
    differently. In the prose system there is an accent called ZARQA,
    which is postposed (on or to the left of the last letter), and in the
    poetic system there is one called TSINOR (and also zarqa and vice-versa;
    each of these has many names) which has the same shape and placement and
    even an analogous function in the structure of the cantillations. There
    is another accent, only in the poetic system, called the TSINNORIT (a
    diminutive of tsinor), which occurs directly above its letter, and is
    (almost?) never on the last letter of its word. (More modern printing
    tends to put the zarqa right on top of its letter too, but that's just a
    printing preference). If you look closely at some old manuscripts, you
    can tell that tsinnorit has a slightly different shape than zarqa/tsinor.</p>
    <p>As encoded in Unicode, there are ZARQA (U+0598) and ZINOR (U+05AE) [sic]. By
    the usual meanings of those names, those should properly be synonyms,
    the same accent, but they're not. While the word"zinor" would be mnemonic of "tsinnorit," it's the wrong
    way around in the character names: ZINOR has the combining class of 
	above-postposed, and ZARQA is encoded to go directly above the letter. So, 
	to encode a zarqa or a tsinor, you need to use ZINOR, and to encode a 
	tsinnorit, you need to use ZARQA.</p>
