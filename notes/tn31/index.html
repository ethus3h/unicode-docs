<h2><a name="Intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Lempel-Ziv compression<sup>[<a href="index.html#LZ77">1</a>]</sup> is based on
replacing sequences of bytes by references to matching sequences
already processed by the encoder. The references are called <i>matches</i>.
The data which don't have any matches are left unmodified. Those are
called <i>literals</i>. See
Fig. 1<sup>[<a href="index.html#Bible">4</a>]</sup> as an example.
<p class="fig_ex">Eli, Eli, lamah azavtani?<br>
Eli, <span style="font-weight: normal;">[5,5]</span>lamah azavtani?</p>
<p class="fig_text">Fig. 1: &ldquo;Eli,
&ldquo; appears twice in the text. We can thus replace the second
reference by a match saying &ldquo;take the sequence 5 characters
before and 5 characters long&rdquo;. The other character sequences
appear once in the text. Those are unmodified in the compressed data
as literals.</p>
<p>There are various modifications of Lempel-Ziv algorithm, differing in
methods of finding the matches and how to store them in the
compressed output. In LZ77, there is a <i>sliding window</i>
holding the last 2, 4 or 32 kB of input. There is also a <i>dictionary</i>
in most of the compression methods, serving as an index to find the
matches quickly.</p>

<h2><a name="UNICODE_Text_Compression">Unicode Text Compression</a></h2>
<p>A few adjustments can be done if the
input is an in-memory block of 16 bit Unicode characters. First of
all, the input can be considered as a series of true 16 bit units,
instead of arbitrary 8 bit data. There is also no need for a sliding
window, since all the data is already present in memory.</p>
<p>The dictionary is organized as a hash
table. The hash is made from two consecutive 16 bit characters. It
serves as an index to an array of pointers to the previous
occurrences of the couple of characters in the text. No effort is
made to find the longest match or to avoid conflicts in hashes. It
results in a worse compression ratio, but much better performance.
The characters found by the hash are simply compared to find the
length of the match and the hash is then updated to point to the
current location. Fig. 2<sup>[<a href="index.html#Kant">5</a>]</sup>
 shows finding a match in the dictionary.</p>
<p class="fig_ex"><img src="hash.gif" alt="hash matching" border="0"></p>
<p class="fig_text">Fig. 2: We get to the position of the previous
occurrence by hashing ' ' and 'k' and looking up the pointer in the
dictionary.</p>
<p>Since the method of looking up the match is fairly
simple, there is quite a lot of literals left in the output. Further
effort is done to reduce the size of the literals as well. The vast
majority of texts uses mainly one alphabet/script. The character
values of a script in the Unicode table are close together. That's
why it's possible to store differences between two 2 byte characters
as a single byte signed value of a range of &lt;-64, 63&gt;. If the
difference between the two characters doesn't fit into the range, the
extra bits are stored in the subsequent byte. That gives a range of
&lt;-8192, 8191&gt;. Three bytes are used in rare cases, when it's
necessary to store the highest bits of the difference as well. The
most significant bit of the bytes is used to mark whether the next
byte holds the extra bits of the current value or the next
difference. Only the first character of a literal is stored directly,
so that we can restore the original values from the differences.</p>
<p class="fig_ex">
A<span style="font-weight: normal"><sub>0041</sub></span>,<span style="font-weight: normal"><sub>002C</sub></span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: normal"><sub>0020</sub></span>&Sigma;<span style="font-weight: normal"><sub>03A3</sub></span><br>
0041 15 0C FD 78</p>
<p class="fig_text">Fig. 3: Encoding
of literal &ldquo;A, &Sigma;&rdquo;.
'A' is stored straight as 41 (on 2 bytes).Then we store ',' as 41 &ndash;
2C = 15 and space as 2C &ndash; 20 = C. &Sigma; doesn't fit to a
single byte, because 20 &ndash; 3A3 = FC7D. It's lowest 7 bits (7D)
are stored in the first byte with its most significant bit set to 1,
signalling that the next byte holds the next bits. The next 7 bits of
FC7D (78) are stored in the next byte and its most significant bit is
left as zero.</p>

<h2><a name="Output_Format">Output Format</a></h2>
<p>Output consists of either literals of
a certain length or matches. A match is a pair of a length and an
offset. To distinguish between literals and matches, we can use one
bit from the length field of both literals and matches. Also both
offset and length of a match and length of a literal can be encoded
in a similar way as the differences between characters in literals &ndash;
one bit saying whether there are more data and the rest of the byte
filled by the value.</p>

<p class="fig_text">Fig. 4:
The most significant bit in the length field is used to
distinguish between a match and a literal, the second most
significant bit says whether the length fits into the remaining 6
bits and the rest holds the lowest 6 bits of the length. If the
length doesn't fit into the 6 bits, another byte (or more) is used to
store the rest. Then the most significant bit says whether the next
byte also holds a part of the length and 7 bits contain another
portion of length.</p>
<p>It's also convenient to store the
original length of uncompressed data for decompression.</p>

<h2><a name="Comp_Algorithm">Compression Algorithm</a></h2>
<p>First of all it's necessary to allocate an output buffer and a dictionary.
Output buffer should be 50% bigger than the input data. Size of the
dictionary depends on a programmer's choice. The more memory the dictionary
uses, the better compression ratio can be reached. The dictionary used for
this article holds 16384 pointers, that's 64KB on a 32-bit machine.</p>
<p>The smallest size of a match is sixteen bits (1B length and 1B offset).
The size of the data replaced by a match must therefore be greater than
sixteen bits in order to reach any compression. That's two Unicode
characters (32 bits) in this case. These two characters must be hashed
to make up an index to the dictionary. An example of a hash is shown in Fig. 5.
</p>
<pre class="code_sample"><code>
int hash(int char0, int char1)
{
  return ((char1 * 37 ^ ((char0 >> 7) * 5) ^ (char0)) * 33) &amp; 16383;
}
</code></pre>
<p class="fig_text">Fig. 5: Hash makes a number ranging from 0 to 16383.
Several character combinations share the same hash value. It's important that
the character values making the same hash are evenly distributed.</p>
<p>A simplified compression is in Fig. 6. OutputMatch is straightforward, just
writing the length and the offset to the output in the format explained above.
OutputLiteral is covered in details are in Fig. 7.</p>
<pre class="code_sample"><code>
literal = input;
while (length-- > 0) {
  match_index = hash(*input, *(input + 1));
  match = dictionary[match_index];
  dictionary[match_index] = input;
  
  if (valid_pointer(match) &amp;&amp; *match == *input &amp;&amp; *(match + 1) == *(input + 1))   {
    if (literal < input)
      OutputLiteral(literal, input - literal);
      
    i = 2;
    while (*(match + i) == *(input + i))
      ++i;
      
    OutputMatch(input - match, i);
    
    input += i;
    literal = input;
    length -= (i - 1);
  }
  else
    ++input;
}

if (literal < input)
  OutputLiteral(literal, input - literal);
</code></pre>
<p class="fig_text">Fig. 6: Whenever a match is found, the not-matched part of
data is sent to output, followed by the match.</p>
<pre class="code_sample"><code>
<span class="comment">// most significant bit is 0 to mark a literal</span>

length >>= 6;

while (length > 0) {
  *(output++) = (unsigned char)(length &amp; 0x7F) | ((length > 0x7F) << 7);
  length >>= 7;
}

<span class="comment">// save the first Unicode character</span>
previous = *input++;
*output++ = previous &amp; 0xFF;
*output++ = previous >> 8;

<span class="comment">// save differences between the characters</span>
while (length-- > 0) {
  diff = previous - *input;
  if ((diff &amp; 0xFFFFFFC0) == 0 || (diff | 0x3F) == -1)
    *output++ = (unsigned char)(diff &amp; 0x7F);
  else {
    *output++ = (unsigned char)((diff &amp; 0x7F) | 0x80);
    diff >>= 7;

    if ((diff &amp; 0xFFFFFFC0) == 0 || (diff | 0x3F) == -1)
      *output++ = (unsigned char)(diff &amp; 0x7F);
    else {
      *output++ = (unsigned char)((diff &amp; 0x7F) | 0x80);
      *output++ = diff >> 7;
    }
  }

  previous = *input++;
}
</code></pre>
<p class="fig_text">Fig. 7 (<b>OutputLiteral</b>):
The length is saved first on as many bytes as needed. Then follows the first
character of the literal (two bytes). After that, differences from the previous
character are saved on one, two or three bytes.</p>

<h2><a name="Decompression">Decompression</a></h2>
<p>Decompression is straightforward and
simple. There is no need to allocate any memory except a buffer to
store the decompressed data.</p>
<p>The most significant bit of a strip of
data says whether it's a match or a literal. Literals are encoded
from the differential code to the output buffer. Since a literal is
always the first strip of the compressed data and a match can only
reference backwards, the matches are copied from the previous data in
the output buffer.</p>
<pre class="code_sample"><code>
while (input < end) {
  if (*input &amp; 0x80) {  <span class="comment">// match</span>
    length = DecodeLength(&amp;input);
    offset = DecodeOffset(&amp;input);  <span class="comment">// same algorithm as DecodeLength</span>
    while (length-- > 0)
    {
      *output = *(output - offset);
      ++output;
    }
  }
  else {  <span class="comment">// literal</span>
    length = DecodeLength(&amp;input);
    *output = *input++;
    *output++ |= ((unsigned int)(*input++)) << 8;
    --length;

    while (length-- > 0) {
      c = *input &amp; 0x7F;
      
      if (*input++ &amp; 0x80) {    <span class="comment">// two bytes</span>
        c |= ((unsigned int)*input &amp; 0x7F) << 7;
        
        if (*input++ &amp; 0x80) {  <span class="comment">// three bytes</span>
          c |= *input++ << 14;
          
          if (c &amp; 0x10000)      <span class="comment">// negative number</span>
            c |= 0xFFFF0000;
        }
        else if (c &amp; 0x2000)    <span class="comment">// negative number</span>
          c |= 0xFFFFC000;
      }
      else if (c &amp; 0x40)        <span class="comment">// negative number</span>
        c |= 0xFFFFFF80;

      *output = *(output - 1) - c;
      ++output;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p class="fig_text">Fig. 8: When decoding a literal, the differences between
the characters might be either positive or negative. We must fill the top bits
by 1 for negative numbers. The code here assumes that c is a 32 bit
integer.<br>
DecodeLength and DecodeOffset just keeps adding
7 bits to the resulting length value as long as the most significant bit of
the byte on input is set.</p>

<h2><a name="Performance">Performance and compression ratio</a></h2>
<p>This algorithm is more than 10 times
faster than standard zip compression<sup>[<a href="index.html#zlib">2</a>]</sup>,
almost independently of a compression level used
(1-9 and even 0 &ndash; no compression). The
speed is the same as LZO<sup>[<a href="index.html#LZO">3</a>]</sup>,
the worlds fastest compression algorithm.
Text is usually compressed to 60% of its original size.</p>
