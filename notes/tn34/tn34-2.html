<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>Recent discussion on the Unicode general email list has raised
a number of issues regarding collation and the Unicode
Collation Algorithm (UCA) specifically.</p>

<p>In particular, there has been much discussion about whether having
a specific word-breaking mechanism built into the UCA would be
an improvement for it, as well as discussion of the problems of
French accent weighting (reversed at the secondary level) for
efficiency in handling certain kinds of list sorting in actual
applications in production.</p>

<p>One of the cases which has been attested as illustrating the
problems with the UCA and the need for a word-breaking mechanism
and other changes is the sorting of topic lists (and other kinds
of lists) on the French Wikipédia.</p>

<p>In lieu of attempting to discuss long examples in email, where
the discussion cannot truly do justice to the examples or the
problems they pose, I have written up this small technical note,
so that I can examine some of the issues in the context of
an extended example using actual data from the French Wikipédia.</p>

<h3>2. <a name="Section_2"></a>Case Study: Ordering a Topic List</h3>

<p>To illustrate some of the problems, I have selected a sublisting
from the "Toutes les pages" topical listing for the French
Wikipédia. In particular:</p>

<p>
<a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sp%C3%A9cial:Toutes_les_pages&amp;from=Fleur&amp;to=Fleuve_Nelson">http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sp%C3%A9cial:Toutes_les_pages&amp;from=Fleur&amp;to=Fleuve_Nelson</a> </p>

<p>(This page was accessed and excerpted 2010-07-13. Note that the exact range of topics for a
particular topic page listing will vary from day to day on the actual site, as entries are
added or modified.)</p>

<h4>2.1. <a name="Section_2_1"></a>Topic List, Order 1</h4>

<p>The excerpted list of interest here, in its actual occurring order
on that page is shown below. (I have deleted out intervening entries,
so as to highlight the collation order issues for "Fleur" and
"Fleur de lys" in the list.)</p>

<pre>Fleur

<p>By inspection of the ordering of this list, it is clear that the
ordering being used is a very simple one. It is a single-level
sort, giving SPACE (and HYPHEN-MINUS and parentheses) a low
primary weight. It also does not treat case distinctions as
ignorable, but rather collates uppercase and lowercase as
distinct letters in ASCII order. Thus it has "H" &lt; "g" in one
obvious instance. Except for the fact that this collation
sorts "-" before SPACE, this ordering is otherwise what one
would expect for a binary string sort.</p>

<p>Obviously this ordering is far from a desirable one for a long
list like this.</p>

<h4>2.2. <a name="Section_2_2"></a>Topic List, Order 2</h4>

<p>A significant improvement in the order would result from a single,
change in the collation to ignore case differences. The result
of that change is shown below.</p>

<pre>Fleur
Fleur-De-Lys
Fleur-de-Lys
Fleur-de-lys

Fleurbaix

Fleurdepied

Fleurs de bach
Fleurs de lis
Fleurs de lys
Fleurs de ruine
...</pre>

<p>This does a much better job of grouping similar strings together
that only differ by casing, and also eliminates ordering
anomalies of the "H" &lt; "g" variety.</p>

<p>However, the list order still has problems, in that it widely separates
what would otherwise be considered closely related strings,
such as "Fleur-de-lys", "Fleur de lys" and "Fleurdelysé".</p>

<h4>2.3. <a name="Section_2_3"></a>Topic List, Order 3</h4>

<p>Now what would happen to this list if ordered instead with
a multi-level collation based on UCA? First, let's consider
the default settings for the UCA implementation by the International
Components for Unicode library [<a href="tn34-2.html#ICU">ICU</a>]. That library does a full
UCA multi-level collation, using the [<a href="tn34-2.html#LDML">LDML</a>] locale tailorings. The default settings
for LDML differ from
the defaults for UCA per se, in that LDML defaults to the "non-ignorable"
option, rather than 
the "shifted" option for weighting. Implementations can, however, reset
that default globally, or for a given locale, or for a tailoring of
a locale, to "shifted".</p>

<p>The choice of the "non-ignorable" option means that the so-called
variable elements (e.g., punctuation and symbols) are given
primary weights, instead of being shifted to a weighting significance
at the fourth level. Given the ICU default settings for the root
locale, the list would order as follows.</p>

<pre>Fleur
Fleur (Disney, Bambi)
Fleur (homonymie)
Fleur (Homonymie)
Fleur (personnage)
Fleur (plante)
Fleur (prénom)
Fleur Adcock
Fleur annuelle
...
Fleur de lampaul
Fleur De Lampaul
Fleur de lis

...
Fleurac
...
Fleurbaix
Fleurdelisé
Fleurdelysé
Fleurdepied
...
Fleurs de bach
Fleurs de lis
Fleurs de lys
Fleurs de ruine
...</pre>

<p>The main differences to be noted here from Order 2 are that lowercase
letters are systematically ordered before uppercase characters, but
with a lower level of significance than for the primary ordering
differences (a &lt; b &lt; c, etc.). Also, the hyphen-minus character
sorts <i>after</i> the space character, instead of before it.</p>

<p>This listing does a better job than Order 2, but still has the problem
of widely separating "Fleur-de-lys", "Fleur de lys" and "Fleurdelysé",
for example.</p>

<h4>2.4. <a name="Section_2_4"></a>Topic List, Order 4</h4>

<p>Now let's consider what would happen to this list if ordered
with a multi-level collation using the UCA with its default settings 
and table. In this case, the collation would be done with
the "shifted" option&#x2014;something that can be accomplished with
the ICU implementation by choosing the "Ignore Punctuation" option.</p>

<pre>Fleur

...</pre>

<p>In particular note that (by design), UCA with the "shifted" option treats 
the weighting of punctuation and spaces as <i>less</i> significant than tertiary-level
(casing) distinctions. This has the intended effect of
grouping together strings that only differ by the presence
or absence of punctuation, as in the case of "Fleur-de-lys",
"Fleur de lys", and "Fleurdelysé", which now occur closely together
in the list.</p>

<p>The bad thing about this ordering, for an application like a
topic list in Wikipedia, is that the entries with parenthetical
annotations are now widely separated from the same entries without
such annotations, because the contents of the annotations are
being collated without separation from the rest of the string.
The order in the original listing was more or less just a side effect
of the fact that the left parenthesis character "(" was 
given a primary weight lower than any
letter, thus forcing all the annotations to sort ahead of any
substring beginning with an actual letter--but that was a side
effect that people were then depending on for the expected order of
entries.</p>

<p>The other problematical aspect of this default UCA ordering is
that many list users are unfamiliar with lists that ignore
spaces, so that "Fleur &lt; Fleurac &lt; Fleur Adcock" just looks
wrong to them. They expect, based on long experience with
single-level computer sorts which weight SPACE as a character
with a primary weight, that all the entries with "Fleur" as the 
first "word" will occur first, before "Fleurac", "Fleurbaix", etc.</p>

<h4>2.5. <a name="Section_2_5"></a>Topic List, Order 5</h4>

<p>So let's attempt to address some of the problems with Order 4
by further "fiddling with the dials" of the collation, so to speak.</p>

<p>First of all, we can set a UCA collation to completely ignore
tertiary (case) differences. This will help a little, because
it will group strings differing by punctuation together a
little better, without allowing case distinctions in letters
to override the punctuation differences.</p>

<p>The next thing we can do is to treat the annotations as
separate <i>fields</i> for collation. In other words, entries
with annotations would be treated by comparing the string
up to the annotation first (using UCA collation), and then
<i>separately</i> ordering next by the annotation (if any).</p>

<p>The ordering which results from these two changes is as
follows:</p>

<pre>Fleur
Fleur (Disney, Bambi)
Fleur (homonymie)
Fleur (Homonymie)
Fleur (personnage)
Fleur (plante)
Fleur (prénom)
Fleurac
Fleur Adcock
Fleur annuelle
Fleurbaix
...
Fleur de lampaul
Fleur De Lampaul
Fleur de lis
Fleurdelisé
Fleur de lune
Fleur de Lune
Fleur de lys
Fleur de Lys
Fleur De Lys
Fleur De Lys (groupe)
Fleur de lys (homonymie)
Fleur De Lys (Homonymie)
Fleur-de-lys
Fleur-de-Lys
Fleur-De-Lys
Fleurdelysé
Fleur de lys florencée
Fleur de ma ville
Fleur de Mai
Fleur De Métal
Fleurdepied
...
Fleurs de bach
Fleurs de lis
Fleurs de lys
Fleurs de ruine
...
Fleur stabilisée
...</pre>

<p>I think this is much closer to user expectations for a wiki
topic list like this. However, this order does not yet address the
issue of people being unprepared for a list that ignores
spaces.</p>

<h4>2.6. <a name="Section_2_6"></a>Topic List, Order 6</h4>

<p>So let's see what can be done about addressing the SPACE issue
here. If we use a tailored UCA collation table, with a (low)
tailored primary weight for SPACE, we will end up with much
of the expected behavior in the listing, while still gaining
the rest of the benefits of the multilevel sorting.</p>

<p>If we use this tailoring for SPACE, while also using the setting 
to ignore case differences and again treating parenthetical 
annotations as a second, separate field for sorting, we get the 
following listing:</p>

<pre>Fleur
Fleur (Disney, Bambi)
Fleur (homonymie)
Fleur (Homonymie)
Fleur (personnage)
Fleur (plante)
Fleur (prénom)
Fleur Adcock
Fleur annuelle
...

Fleur-de-lys
Fleur-de-Lys
Fleur-De-Lys
Fleurdelysé
Fleurdepied
...
Fleurs de bach
Fleurs de lis
Fleurs de lys
Fleurs de ruine
...</pre>

<p>I suspect that this is about the best you can do to meet user
expectations for a listing like this, without starting down the
path to much fancier (and expensive) techniques such as
lemmatizing.</p>

<p>For example, in principle, it would be very nice if a plural
entry such as "Fleurs de lys"
could be found in the list right next to "Fleur de lys", instead
of after "Fleurbaix,... Fleurdepied...," and many other entries.
However, to accomplish that requires lemmatizing (which in turn requires
support from a morphological dictionary) that knows that "Fleurs"
is a plural form of "Fleur" and should be grouped with a
singular head entry.</p>

<p>Similarly, it would be helpful to group alternative spellings
together in some way, so that "Fleur de lis" is related to
"Fleur de lys" in some apparent way, rather than being
separated alphabetically by the unrelated "Fleur de lune", but identifying
variant spellings requires dictionary lookup, and listing them
usably requires some kind of cross-reference mechanism, rather
than a simple list.</p>

<p>Lemmatized lists also cannot easily be presented as simple lists like
this one. If you attempt to do so, you end up with lists that
don't look like they are "in alphabetical order", thus confusing
the users. Fully lemmatized lists are instead generally presented
in some kind of layered structure as "dictionary entries"&#x2014;with
lemmatized headwords, and with related items subordered beneath those
headwords according to various principles.</p>

<h3>3. <a name="Section_3"></a>Implications for the Unicode Collation Algorithm</h3>

<p>If we can agree that an ordering for a topical list somewhat similar
to that described above under Order 6 is roughly what people would
prefer in such listings (as opposed to the existing behavior
demonstrated under Order 1), are there implications that extend
to how the Unicode Collation Algorithm should be applied or
possibly modified to facilitate such ordering?</p>

<p>It has been argued that such topical list sorting poses
additional requirements for the Unicode Collation Algorithm,
and in particular that the behavior of French accents (which are
weighted in the reverse direction at the secondary level in
the UCA) poses difficulties for sorting such lists.</p>

<p>It should be apparent from the discussion above that in principle
topical list sorting of this type is not particularly problematical.
If the correct parameters are chosen for a UCA-based multilevel
sort, with a tailoring of the SPACE character to match expectations,
and with parenthetical trailing annotations treated as a separately
weighted field, the expected results fall out fairly easily,
as shown above.</p>

<p>It could be argued, however, that the algorithm should be enhanced so that
this particular behavior occurs by default, so that proper
handling of trailing annotations would result by simply comparing
the full strings according to the algorithm. But
it is clear that the UCA was not intended to be able to mimic the
collation of fielded data. It is actually a better design to keep
it as is, because there is no easy way to enhance the algorithm
to mimic all the kinds of effects people might want from sequential
comparison of separate fields, and an attempt to do so might
clutter up the algorithm in ways that would disturb its intended
scope for the simple comparison of two strings. Fielded comparisons
need to be done by actually <i>fielding</i> the data to be compared.
That is a much more flexible approach to the general problem than
trying to build it into the string comparison (or sortkey construction)
primitives for collation.</p>

<p>However, while in principle ordering such lists is not very
complex, there may be practical concerns regarding storage,
performance, or other issues which concern people. So let's
take up a discussion of those issues.</p>

<h4>3.1. <a name="Section_3_1"></a>Incremental Comparison and Stored Keys</h4>

<p>The two main ways that the UCA is implemented in APIs are for
incremental string comparison and for construction of full sortkeys
for storage for binary comparison.</p>

<p>Incremental string comparison is optimal for the quick comparison
of two strings according to a UCA multi-level collation table,
but where the comparison of the same strings does not have to
be done multiple times. In incremental comparison, collation elements
for the strings are only compared until a difference is found between
the strings, and a full sortkey doesn't have to be constructed.
This saves both processing time and (usually) memory allocation.</p>

<p>Construction of full sortkeys for storage and later binary comparison
is optimal for tasks such as the indexing of large tables, where
any given single string may need to be compared hundreds, thousands,
or even millions of times against other strings. In such a context,
the additional processing time and allocation overhead to construct
and store full sortkeys may be far outweighed by the gains from
being able to do the multiple comparisons using very fast binary
memory comparison (memcmp) operations on the stored sortkeys.</p>

<h4>3.2. <a name="Section_3_2"></a>French Accent Weighting</h4>

<p>The particular issue posed by rules for French accent weighting
and the UCA is that the lexicographical ordering rules for French
accents specify that they are significant from the <i>end</i> of strings,
rather than from the beginning. This differs from the treatment
of accents for most languages in collation, and results in special
parameters and sortkey construction rules for French in the UCA.
(For details, see [<a href="tn34-2.html#UTS10">UTS10</a>].)</p>

<p>The concern for now is whether the requirements for handling French
accents cause significant performance or architectural issues for
handling cases such as sorting topical lists in the French Wikipédia.</p>

<p>There is no question that the French accent handling in UCA imposes
a performance penalty for comparing strings according to French rules.
The disagreement is regarding how significant that performance penalty
is, and whether it is related in some important way to the length
and structure of strings to be compared.</p>

<p>In the case of construction of full sortkeys, the performance penalty
for French reverse accent weighting is essentially trivial, unless
working with truly enormous strings and keys that require piecewise
buffering. If the algorithm has
complete buffer access to the string and if the sortkey output can be
preallocated, then the secondary weights are simply filled into the
output key in reverse order. If the sortkey is constructed stepwise
from the front of the string, and in particular in cases of very
large strings, where it may not be practical to hold onto the
entire string at once in fast buffers, then a practical approach to
the problem is to construct the entire sortkey in forward order,
and then once it has been constructed, reverse the run of secondary
key weights. Doing so imposes a performance penalty in key construction,
but particularly in cases where there is separate optimization to
compact sortkeys into shorter lengths, such secondary key reversal
can be incorporated into the rest of the sortkey post-processing.</p>

<p>For incremental string comparison, on the other hand, the situation
for French accent reversal is rather simpler. An efficient incremental
string comparison doing French accent handling simply keeps track
of a secondary weight flag while processing the string incrementally.
Only if the processing gets all the way to the end of the string
without a primary difference having been triggered, does the
secondary flag then need to be examined. And when it is checked,
it simply has flagged the <i>last</i> secondary comparison that made
a difference, rather than the <i>first</i> in the string. There is never
any need to reprocess the string from the back to the front, just
to check secondary weights incrementally. The code to keep track
of this secondary weight flag makes the incremental comparison
algorithm more complicated, but the performance difference for
forward accent weighting versus reverse accent weighting is down
in the noise.</p>

<p>Now if we consider this reverse accent weighting in the context
of requests for word boundary determination in the UCA, it becomes
apparent that neither full sortkey construction nor incremental
string comparison would require some kind of word boundary chunking
of the strings for comparison, in order to have efficient (and correct)
key construction.</p>

<p>For full, stored sortkeys, if there is a secondary (accent) distinction
in the first word of two compared entries, it is still correct
and necessary to check the primary weights of all the subsequent
words in both strings for a difference, before that secondary distinction
in the first word could be determinative of order. The sortkeys are
already constructed so that the binary comparisons work by hitting
a difference in the key at precisely the first point that makes a
difference. Introducing some kind of word breaker to chunk the
string into word increments for sortkey construction doesn't help at
all. Instead, what word chunking does is attempt to emulate a string comparison based
on fields for each word, and if used when actually building
full sortkeys for a string would just produce rather jumbled and 
hard-to-interpret results.</p>

<p>For incremental string comparison, roughly the same considerations
apply. A properly constructed implementation of an incremental string
comparison gets to a significant secondary comparison at precisely
the correct point&#x2014;which is also the earliest possible point in
the comparison that the difference could be significant. Introducing
a word chunking step into the comparison accomplishes precisely nothing.</p>

<h4>3.3. <a name="Section_3_3"></a>Truncation and UCA</h4>

<p>In practical applications such as a wiki topical list, there may,
however, be additional considerations. If an application is
constrained in storage, it may need to make various modifications
to what would otherwise be an ideal implementation. In particular,
there may be cases where implementations of long, large lists
are designed to truncate either the strings themselves or the stored
sortkeys (or both).</p>

<p>If the <i>strings</i> for long lists are truncated, that is an application
design issue that is basically outside the consideration of UCA
per se. UCA (or any other weighted string comparison mechanism)
can only work with the input data it has.</p>

<p>Effective truncation of strings depends on an application designer
correctly identifying what parts of strings represent redundant
information, and what represent locally significant information.
If the data for lists contains long segments of repetitive and
redundant information that interfere with seeing, displaying, or
comparing the significantly different portions, application strategies that
can be taken include (database) normalization into distinct tables
for different parts of the strings. For display of such data, one
can devise hierarchical strategies that mask repetitive data.
For <i>ordering</i> of such hierarchical lists, the string comparisons
(or sortkey storage) would be done separately at each level of
the hierarchy, and if done that way, each comparison would be done
with shorter strings (or shorter keys) relevant to the level in
question.</p>

<p>In any case, these kinds of approaches are effectively means of
fielding the data and then doing ordering within those fields.
It is the choice of the design for fielding the data that makes
the difference. The sortkey construction mechanism itself does
not require special tweaking for word-by-word parsing (or other
kinds of chunking) to then work efficiently to support ordering
of the fielded lists.</p>

<p>On the other hand if the application design chooses to truncate
<i>sortkeys</i>, there can be more unexpected results. An application
that uses an implementation of UCA to construct sortkeys for
arbitrarily long strings, but which then truncates them at
some defined size for storage is essentially saying that at some point
for long strings it doesn't matter how they compare&#x2014;as beyond
that point (and somewhat at random from the point of view of
what is in them) strings will not compare
as different even if their content actually is different.</p>

<p>When faced with a tradeoff like this, it would make sense to use
whatever options the implementation has to optimize and compact
sortkeys, as at least such options "know what they are doing" in
making sortkeys shorter, whereas simple truncation of sortkeys
is done without knowing at what point in a string and at
what level of significance the truncation will matter.</p>

<p>It has been claimed that in a situation like this, and in particular
for French data, that augmenting UCA with a word breaking option
would somehow help with the problem and produce better results for
list ordering when sortkeys are being truncated for long
strings, but I think that claim is incorrect. First, if, as is usually
the case, most strings in the list compare unequal at the primary level
fairly early in the strings, attempting to chunk the strings for
sortkey construction isn't going to matter for those strings anyway.
Second, in the aberrant case in which there are many 
strings that have long identical prefixes and where the significant
differences are getting lost due to sortkey truncation, the chunking
isn't going to help, either&#x2014;in such a case truncation of sortkeys
is simply an application design error, and the problem should be
handled in some other way.</p>

<p>But more fundamentally, word chunking for key construction doesn't
really accomplish what its proponents seem to be claiming for it,
as illustrated by the following schematic example. Compare
the strings:</p>

<pre>    
   aaá xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx...
   aaa xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx...
</pre>

<p>The essential claim seems to be that <i>if</i> I have strings like this,
where there is a secondary difference early in a string, say in
the very first "word" of the data, and <i>if</i> the strings are otherwise
primary equal for the rest of the strings, and <i>if</i> my application
is doing arbitrary length sortkey truncation which turns out to
have truncated the secondary difference, so that I cannot tell
that the first string actually compares greater than the second,
then an enhancement to UCA that constructs sortkeys one word chunk
at a time will get the correct answer for these strings.</p>

<p>Such an argument hangs on a very thin thread, however, because it
assumes that the truncation is only hitting the secondary weights
and not any primary weights. For example, given the following
strings and a truncation which hits the sortkeys at the point
indicated in the strings by a caret:</p>

<pre>    
   aaá xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx^xxxx...
   aaa xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx^xxxy...
</pre>

<p>An answer based on the difference in the accent in the first word
would actually be wrong. The more significant difference in the
primary weights (for the "y") would have been lost in the truncation.
Essentially, you cannot get the correct results for long strings
by comparing only the first words (including their secondary
differences), unless you continue processing until you run out of
primary differences, which could be very, very far along the string
indeed.</p>

<p>And the situation for word-by-word chunking as a part of the sortkey
construction only gets more complicated when you start introducing
differences in word lengths, and start to consider the issues of
how to parse and/or weight punctuation that might or might not be
considered word boundaries, such as hyphens and apostrophes.</p>

<p>I conclude from this that an "enhancement" of UCA sortkey construction
to somehow include a word boundary breaker isn't at all an answer
for the conundrums and errors of comparison which may result from
sortkey truncation for long strings. In such cases, the better answer
is to examine the application design and the nature of the strings
to be compared, to look for other optimizations that would produce
better results given the application's storage constraints.</p>

<h4>3.4. <a name="Section_3_4"></a>The Real Goal of a Word-Chunking Enhancement</h4>

<p>If a request for a word-chunking enhancement to the UCA to deal
with edge case problems for sortkey truncation makes no sense,
then what is the actual problem in list ordering that people
advocating for it are trying to address.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the <i>real</i> goal here is to "fix" the behavior that
the UCA algorithm displays when using the default table and default parameters,
which results in listings that don't treat spaces as having
primary weights, and which thus don't highlight word identity
(by which people usually mean just "things separated by spaces") 
in ordered listings. In other words, people just don't
like lists ordered as in the example in Section 2.4 above.</p>

<p>The fix for that, however, is not to somehow build in a word-breaker
in the default algorithm, but instead to address the <i>actual</i> 
user issue, which is how spaces are being weighted for comparison.</p>

<p>Using the default settings for the ICU implementation gives
the expected behavior for spaces, as long as the desired collation
doesn't also require ignoring other punctuation differences.</p>

<p>If a collation is desired which ignores punctuation differences
but still considers spaces as significant,
the simple expedient of giving the space character a low primary
weight and building sortkeys (or comparing strings incrementally)
with that weighting restores the salient aspect of the list
ordering that people are actually looking for, as demonstrated
in the example in Section 2.6 above. Such behavior is entirely
consistent with the UCA as currently defined. All it requires
is tailoring the weight for SPACE in the default table, or
alternatively supporting such a reweighting parametrically in
an implementation of the UCA.</p>
