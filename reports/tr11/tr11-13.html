  <h2><a name="Overview">1 Overview</a></h2>
<p>When dealing with East Asian Text there is the concept of an <i>inherent</i> 
width of a character. This width takes on either of two values: <i>narrow </i>or
<i>wide.</i> For traditional mixed-width East Asian legacy character sets this classification into
narrow and wide corresponds with few exceptions directly to the storage size for each
character: a few narrow characters use a single byte per character and all other
characters (usually wide) use two or more bytes.</p>
	<p>Layout and line breaking (to cite only two examples) in East 
Asian context show systematic variations depending on the value of this East-Asian 
Width property. <i>Wide</i> characters  behave like ideographs; they tend to allow 
line breaks after each character and remain upright in vertical text layout. 
<i>Narrow</i> characters are kept together in words or runs that are rotated 
sideways in vertical text layout.</p>
	<p>For a traditional East Asian <em>fixed pitch</em> font, this width
  translates to a display width of either one half or a whole unit width. A
  common name for this unit width is &quot;Em&quot;. While 
  an Em is   customarily the <em>height</em>  of the letter 'M',  
  it is the same as the unit <em>width</em> in East 
  Asian fonts, because in these fonts  the standard character cell  is square.
  In contrast the character width for a fixed pitch Latin font
    like Courier is generally 3/5 of an Em.</p>
    <p>In modern practice, most alphabetic characters
    are rendered by variable width fonts using narrow characters, even if their
    encoding in common legacy sets uses multiple bytes.</p>
    
  <p>Except for a few characters, which are explicitly
  called out as <i>full-width</i> or <i>half-width</i> in the Unicode Standard, 
	characters are not duplicated based on distinction in width. 
  Some characters,  such as the ideographs, are always wide, others are always narrow and some
  can be narrow or wide, depending on context. The Unicode character property,
  <i>East Asian Width</i> provides a default classification of characters, which an
  implementation can use to decide at run-time whether to treat a character
  as narrow or wide.</p>

  <h2>2 <a name="Scope">Scope</a></h2>
  <p>The East Asian Width is an informative property and provides a useful
  concept for implementations that
  <ul>
    <li>have to interwork with East Asian legacy character encodings</li>
    <li>support both East Asian and Western typography and line layout</li>
    <li>need to associate fonts with unmarked text runs containing East Asian
      characters</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This Unicode Technical Report gives general guidelines how to use this
  property. It does not provide rules or specifications of how this property
  might be used in font design or line layout, since, while a useful property
  for this purpose, it is only one of several character properties that would
  need to be considered. The specific assignments of property values for given
  characters may change over time to reflect evolving practice and should be
  considered recommendations that may be overridden by implementations.</p>
  <h2>3 <a name="Description">Description</a></h2>
  <p>By convention, 1/2 Em wide characters of East Asian legacy encodings are
  called &quot;half-width&quot; (or <em>hankaku</em> characters in Japanese),
  the others are called correspondingly &quot;full-width&quot; (or <em>zenkaku</em>)
  characters. Legacy encodings often use a single byte for the half-width
  characters and two bytes for the full-width characters. In the Unicode
  Standard, no such distinction is made, but understanding the distinction is
  often necessary when interchanging data with legacy systems, especially when
  fixed size buffers are involved.</p>
  <p>Some character blocks in the compatibility zone contain characters that are
  explicitly marked &quot;half-width&quot; and &quot;full-width&quot; in their
  character name but for all other characters the width property must be
  implicitly derived. Some characters behave differently in East Asian context
  than in non-East Asian content. Their default width property is considered
  ambiguous and needs to be resolved into an actual width property based on
  context.</p>
  <p>The Unicode Character Database [<a href="tr11-13.html#UCD">UCD</a>] assigns to each
  Unicode character one of the six values <em>Ambiguous, Full Width, Half Width,
  Narrow, Wide</em>, or <em>Not East Asian Neutral</em> (defined below) as its
  default width property. For any given operation, these six default property
  values resolve into only two property values <em>narrow </em>and <em>wide, </em>depending
  on context.</p>

  <p><em>ED1. East Asian Width</em> - in the context of interoperating with East
  Asian legacy character encodings and implementing East Asian typography, the
  East Asian Width is a categorization of character. It can take on two abstract
  values, <strong>narrow</strong> and <strong>wide</strong>. In legacy
  implementations, there is often a corresponding difference in encoding length
  (one or two bytes) as well as a difference in displayed width. However, the <em>actual</em>
  display width of a glyph is given by the font and may be further adjusted by
  layout. An important class of fixed width legacy fonts contains glyphs of just
  two widths with the wider glyphs twice as wide as the narrower glyphs.</p>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: For convenience, the classification further
    distinguishes among explicitly or implicitly wide and narrow characters.<font color="#0000FF"></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>ED2. East Asian Full-width </em>(<em>F</em>) - all characters that are
  defined as FULL WIDTH in the Unicode Standard [<a href="tr11-13.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]
  by having a compatibility decomposition of type &lt;wide&gt; to characters
  elsewhere in the Unicode Standard that are implicitly narrow but unmarked.</p>
  <p><em>ED3. East Asian Half-width</em> (<em>H</em>) - all characters that are
  explicitly defined as HALF WIDTH in the Unicode Standard by having a
  compatibility decomposition of type &lt;narrow&gt; to characters elsewhere in
  the Unicode Standard that are implicitly wide but unmarked, plus the WON SIGN.</p>
  <p><em>ED4. East Asian Wide (W) </em>- all other characters that are <i>always</i>
  wide. These characters occur only in the context of East Asian typography
  where they are wide characters (such as the Unified Han Ideographs or Squared
  Katakana Symbols). This category includes characters that have explicit
  half-width counterparts.</p>
  <p><em>ED5. East Asian Narrow (Na) - </em>all other characters that are <i>always</i>
  narrow and&nbsp;have explicit full-width or wide counterparts. These
  characters are implicitly narrow in East Asian typography and legacy character
  sets since they have explicit full-width or wide counterparts. All of ASCII is
  an example of East Asian Narrow characters.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is useful to distinguish characters explicitly defined as half-width
    from other narrow characters. In particular, half-width punctuation behaves
    in some important ways like ideographic punctuation, and knowing a character
    is a half-width character can aid in font selection when binding a font to
    unstyled text.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>ED6. East Asian Ambiguous (A) </em>- all characters that can be
  sometimes wide and sometimes narrow. Ambiguous characters require additional
  information not contained in the character code to further resolve their
  width.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ambiguous characters occur in East Asian legacy character sets as <em>wide</em>
    characters, but as <em>narrow</em> (i.e. normal-width) characters in
    non-East Asian usage (Examples are the Greek and Cyrillic alphabet found in
    East Asian character sets, but also some of the mathematical symbols).&nbsp;
    Private Use characters are considered ambiguous by 
    default, since additional
    information is required to know whether they should be treated as wide or
    narrow.</p>

  <h3><a name="Relation">4.1 Relation to the terms &quot;full-width&quot; and
  &quot;half-width&quot;</a></h3>
  <p>When converting a DBCS mixed-width encoding to and from Unicode, the
  full-width characters in such a mixed-width encoding are mapped to the
  full-width compatibility characters in the FFxx block, whereas the
  corresponding half-width characters are mapped to ordinary Unicode characters
  (e.g. ASCII in U+0021..U+007E, plus a few other scattered characters).</p>
  <p>In the context of interoperability with DBCS character encodings, this
  restricted set of Unicode characters in the General Scripts area can be
  construed as half-width, rather than full-width. (This applies only to the
  restricted set of characters that can be paired with the full-width
  compatibility characters.)</p>
  <p>In the context of interoperability with DBCS character encodings, all other
  Unicode characters, which are not explicitly marked as half-width can be
  construed as full-width.</p>
  <p>In any other context, Unicode characters not explicitly marked as being
  either full-width or half-width compatibility forms are neither half-width nor
  full-width.</p>
  <p>Seen in this light, the &quot;half-width&quot; and &quot;full-width&quot;
  properties are not unitary character properties in the same sense as
  &quot;space&quot; or &quot;combining&quot; or &quot;alphabetic&quot;. They
  are, instead, relational properties of a pair of characters, one of which is
  explicitly encoded as a half-width or full-width form for compatibility in
  mapping to DBCS mixed-width character encodings.</p>
  <p>What is &quot;full-width&quot; by default today could in theory become
  &quot;half-width&quot; tomorrow by the introduction of another character on
  the SBCS part of a mixed-width code page somewhere, requiring the introduction
  of another full-width compatibility character to complete the mapping.
  However, since the single byte part of mixed-width character sets is limited,
  there are not going to be many candidates and neither the Unicode Technical
  Committee [<a href="tr11-13.html#UTC">UTC</a>] nor WG2 have any intention to add
  additional compatibility characters for this purpose.</p>
  <h3>4.2 <a name="Ambiguous">Ambiguous characters</a></h3>
  <p>Ambiguous width characters are all those characters that can occur as
  full-width characters in any of a number of East Asian legacy character
  encodings. They have a 'resolved' width of either narrow or wide depending on
  the context of their use. If they are not used in context of the specific
  legacy encoding they belong to, their width resolves to narrow. Otherwise it
  resolves to full-width or half-width. The term <i>context</i> as used here
  includes extra information such as explicit markup, knowledge of the source
  codepage, font information, or language and script identification. For
  example:
  <ul>
    <li>Greek characters resolve to narrow when used with a standard Greek font,
      since there is no East Asian legacy context.</li>
    <li>Private use character codes and the replacement character have ambiguous
      width, since they may stand in for characters of any width.</li>
    <li>Ambiguous quotation marks are generally resolved to wide, when they
      enclose and are adjacent to a wide character, and to narrow otherwise.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Note:</b> Modern practice is evolving towards rendering ever more of the
  ambiguous characters with proportionally spaced, narrow forms that rotate with
  the direction of writing, making a distinction within the 
	legacy character set. In
  other words, context information beyond the choice of font or source character
  set is employed to resolve the width of the character. This document does not
  attempt to track such changes in practice; therefore, the set of characters with mappings to legacy character sets 
  that have been assigned ambiguous width form a superset of the set of
  such characters that may be rendered as 
  wide characters in a given context. In 
  particular, an application might find it useful to treat character from alphabetic scripts as narrow by default.
  On the other hand, many of the symbols in the Unicode Standard have 
	no mappings
  to legacy character sets, yet they may be rendered as 'wide' characters if they appear
  in an East Asian context. An implementation might therefore elect to treat them as ambiguous
 even though they are classified as <i>neutral</i> here.</p>
  <h2>5 <a name="Conformance">Conformance</a></h2>
  <p>East Asian Width is an informative character property and implies no
  conformance requirements.</p>
  <h2>6 <a name="Recommendations">Recommendations</a></h2>
  <p><em>When mapping Unicode to East Asian legacy character encodings</em>
  <ul>
    <li>Wide Unicode characters <strong>always </strong>map to full-width
      characters</li>
    <li>Narrow (and neutral) Unicode characters <strong>always </strong>map to
      half-width characters</li>
    <li>Half-width Unicode characters <strong>always </strong>map to half-width
      characters</li>
    <li>Ambiguous Unicode characters <strong>always </strong>map to full-width
      characters</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>When mapping Unicode to non-East Asian legacy character encodings</em>
  <ul>
    <li>Wide Unicode characters <strong>do not</strong> map to <strong>non</strong>-East
      Asian legacy character encodings</li>
    <li>Narrow (and neutral) Unicode characters <strong>always </strong>map to 
	regular (narrow) characters</li>
    <li>Half-width Unicode characters <strong>do not </strong>map</li>
    <li>Ambiguous Unicode characters <strong>always</strong> map to regular 
	(narrow) characters</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>When processing or displaying data</em>
  <ul>
    <li>Wide characters behave like ideographs in important ways, such as
      layout. Except for certain punctuation characters, they are not rotated
      when appearing in vertical text runs. In fixed pitched fonts, they take up
      one Em of space.</li>
    <li>Half-width characters behave like ideographs in some ways, however, they
      are rotated like narrow characters when appearing in vertical text runs.
      In fixed pitched fonts, they take up 1/2 Em of space.</li>
    <li>Narrow characters behave like Western characters, for example, in line
      breaking. They are rotated sideways, when appearing in vertical text. In
      fixed pitched East Asian fonts, they take up 1/2 Em of space, but in
      rendering, a non-East Asian, proportional font is often substituted.</li>
    <li>Ambiguous characters behave like wide or narrow characters depending on
      context (language tag, script identification, associated font, source of
      data, or explicit markup; all can provide the context). 
      If the context cannot be established reliably they should be treated as
      narrow characters by default.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>7 <a name="Classifications">Classifications</a></h2>
  <p>The classifications presented here are based on the most widely used
  mixed-width legacy character sets in use in East Asia as of this writing. In
  particular, the assignments of the <strong>neutral</strong> or <strong>ambiguous</strong>
  categories depend on the contents of these character sets. For example, an
  implementation that knows a-priori that it <em>only</em> needs to interchange
  data with the Japanese Shift-JIS character set, but not other East Asian
  character sets, could reduce the number of characters in the <strong>ambiguous</strong>
  classification to those actually encoded in Shift-JIS. Or such a reduction
  could be done implicitly at runtime in the context of interoperating with
  Shift-JIS fonts or data sources. Conversely, if additional character sets are
  created and widely adopted for legacy purposes, more characters would need to
  be classified as ambiguous.</p>
  <h3><a name="Unassigned">7.1 Unassigned and Private Use characters</a></h3>
  <p>All unassigned characters are by default classified as non-East Asian
  neutral, except for the range U+20000 to U+2FFFD, since all code positions
  from U+20000 to U+2FFFD and U+30000 to U+3FFFD are intended for CJK ideographs (W). All Private use
  characters are by default classified as ambiguous, since their definition
  depends on context.</p>
  <p>For additional recommendation for handling the default property value for
  unassigned characters see Section 5.3 of The Unicode Standard, Version 4.0 [<a href="tr11-13.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
  <h3><a name="Combining">7.2 Combining Marks</a></h3>
  <p>Combining marks have been classified and are given a property assignment
  based on their typical applicability. For example combining marks typically
  applied to characters of class <strong>N</strong>, <strong>Na</strong> or <strong>W</strong>
  are classified as <strong>A</strong>. Combining marks for purely non-East
  Asian scripts are marked as <strong>N</strong>, and non-spacing marks used
  only with wide characters are given a <strong>W</strong>. Even more so than
  for other characters, the <em>East Asian width</em> property for combining
  marks is not the same as their display width.</p>
  <p>In particular, non-spacing marks do not possess actual advance width.
  Therefore, even when displaying combining marks, the East Asian Width property
  cannot be related to the advance width of these characters. However, it can be
  useful in determining the encoding length in a legacy encoding, or the choice
  of font for the range of characters including that non-spacing mark. The width
  of the glyph image of a non-spacing mark should always be chosen as the
  appropriate one for the width of the base character.</p>
  <h3><a name="DataFile">7.3 Data File</a></h3>
  <p>The East Asian Width classification of all Unicode characters at the time
  of the publication of this document is available in the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/4.0-Update/EastAsianWidth-4.0.0.txt">current
  version</a> of the file EastAsianWidth.txt [<a href="tr11-13.html#Data">Data</a>] in the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeCharacterDatabase.html">Unicode
  Character Database</a> [<a href="tr11-13.html#UCD">UCD</a>]. This is a tab-delimited, two
  column plain text file, with code position, East Asian Width designator.&nbsp;
  A comment at the end of each line indicates the character name. Ideographic,
  Hangul, Surrogate, and Private Use ranges are collapsed by giving a range in
  the first column.</p>
  <p>As more character are added to the Unicode Standard, or if additional
  character sets are created and widely adopted for legacy purposes, the
  assignment of East Asian Width may be changed for some characters.
  Implementations should not make any assumptions to the contrary. Any future
  updates will be reflected in the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/EastAsianWidth.txt">latest
  version</a> of the data file. (See the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/ucd/">Unicode
  Character Database</a> [<a href="tr11-13.html#UCD">UCD</a>] for any specific version of
  the datafile).</p>
  <h3>7.4 <a name="Adding">Adding Characters</a></h3>
  <p>The sets of East Asian Narrow, East Asian Full-width and East Asian
  Half-width are fixed for all practical purposes. New characters for most
  scripts will be East Asian Neutral characters, unless the script is an East
  Asian script using wide characters, and then the new characters will be
  classified as East Asian Wide. One important exception consists of those new
  symbol characters that are, or are expected to be used both as wide characters
  in East Asian usage and narrow characters in non-East Asian usage. These would
  need to be classified as East Asian Ambiguous.</p>

  <p>Michel Suignard provided extensive input into the analysis and source
  material for the detail assignments of these properties. Mark Davis and Ken
  Whistler performed consistency checks on the data files at various times.
  Tomohiro Kubota reviewed the East Asian Width assignments against some common
  legacy encodings.</p>
  <h2><a name="Changes">Modifications</a></h2>
  <p><b>Revision 13:</b></p>
  <p>Further clarified the definition of ambiguous width. Migrated some formatting to stylesheet.</p>
  <p><b>Revision 11:</b></p>
  <p>Extended the range for the default wide property value to 30000–3FFFD.</p>
  <p><b>Revision 10:</b></p>
  <p>Reworded the definitions of <b>F</b> and <b>H</b> to explicitly refer to
  the compatibility decomposition. <b>Changed</b> 3000 from <b>W</b> to <b>F</b>,
  to align with the revised definitions. Extended the definition for <b>Na </b>to
  include all characters that have a wide equivalent, whether F or W. <b>Changed</b>
  2329..232A, 3008..3009, and 301A..301B from <b>A</b> to <b>W</b> to reflect
  the addition of 27E6..27EB which are their <b>Na</b> equivalents. Also <b>changed</b>
  3018..3019 from <b>A</b> to <b>W</b> to reflect their intended use as CJK-only
  punctuation. <b>Changed</b> 2155 and 2574 from <b>A</b> to <b>N</b>, as they
  were mistaken entries. <b>Changed</b> 24C0..24CF and 2776..277F from <b>N</b>
  to <b>A</b> to reflect their treatment in practice. Revised sections 2, 4.2
  and 6.</p>
  <p><b>Revision 9:</b></p>
  <p>Updated links to new version of data file. <b>Changed</b> 00AE, 014B, 02C4,
  02DF, 2022, 2024, 203E, 2116, 2153, 215C..215D, 21B8..21B9, 21E7and 273D from <b>N</b>
  to <b>A</b> . This is a result of a recent review of existing mapping tables
  showing their use as wide characters in widely implemented East Asian legacy
  encodings. [Revision 9 was never published].</p>
  <p><b>Revision 8:</b></p>
  <p>Change in header for Unicode 3.1. New status section and new format for
  references. Properties assigned to the new characters added to Unicode 3.1. <b>Changed</b>
  2329..232A and 3008-3009 from <b>N</b> to <b>A</b> and <b>W</b> to <b>A</b>
  respectively. This is a result of their canonical equivalence.</p>
  <p><b>Revision 7:</b></p>
  <p>Change in header for Unicode 3.0.1, change in file versioning format.</p>
  <p><b>Version 6.0:</b></p>
  <p>Restated the definitions so that the wording more clearly reflects the
  intent. <b>No changes</b> to the assignments of properties to any character
  were made. Added a section on classifying characters that are to be added to
  the standard in the future. Also added figure 2.</p>
  <p><b>Version 5.0:</b></p>
  <p>Changed the spelling of the title and made minor clarifying changes to the
  definitions and the description of ambiguous characters and combining marks.
  As result of the Unicode 3.0 beta process, <b>changed</b> some CJK punctuation
  characters from W to A since they are also used in Western mathematical
  notation. Removed some historic information and made other edits to prepare TR
  for publication as part of Unicode 3.0.</p>
