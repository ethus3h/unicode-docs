<h2><a name="Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The Unicode Standard  [<a href="tr20-6.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] defines the
universal character set. Its primary goal is to provide an unambiguous
encoding of the content of plain text, ultimately covering all languages in
the world. Currently in its third major version, Unicode contains a large
number of characters covering most of the currently used scripts in the
world. It also contains additional characters for interoperability with older
character encodings, and characters with control-like functions included
primarily for reasons of providing unambiguous interpretation of plain text.
Unicode provides specifications for use of all of these characters.</p>

<p>For document and data interchange, the Internet and the World Wide Web are
more and more making use of marked-up text such as <a href="tr20-6.html#html40">HTML</a>
and <a href="tr20-6.html#xml10">XML</a>. In many instances, markup provides the same, or
essentially similar features to those provided by format characters in the
Unicode Standard for use in plain text. Another special character category
provided by Unicode are compatibility characters. While there may be valid
reasons to support these characters and their specifications in plain text,
their use in marked-up text can conflict with the rules of the markup
language. Formatting characters are discussed in chapters <a
href="tr20-6.html#General">2</a> and <a href="tr20-6.html#Charlist">3</a>, compatibility characters
in chapter <a href="tr20-6.html#Compatibility">4</a>.</p>

<p>Issues resulting from canonical equivalences and Normalization [<a
href="tr20-6.html#UTR15">Normalization</a>]
as well as the interaction of character encoding and methods of escaping
characters in markup are discussed in the Character Model for the World Wide
Web [<a href="tr20-6.html#Charmod">Charmod</a>].</p>

<p>The issues of using Unicode characters with marked-up text depend to some
degree on the rules of the markup language in question and the set of
elements it contains. In a narrow sense, this document concerns itself only
with XML, and to some extent HTML. However, much of the general information
presented here should be useful in a broader context, including some page
layout languages.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b><a name="Note">Note:</a></b> Many of the recommendations of this
  report depend on the availability of particular markup. Where possible,
  appropriate DTDs or Schemas should be used or designed to make such markup
  available, or the DTDs or Schemas used should be appropriately extended.
  The current version of this document makes no specific recommendations for
  the design of DTDs or schemas, or for the use of particular DTDs or
  Schemas, but the information presented here may be useful to designers of
  DTDs and Schemas, and to people selecting DTDs or Schemas for their
  applications. The recommendations of this report do not apply in the case
  of XML used for blind data transport and similar cases.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="Notation">1.1 Notation</a></h3>

<p>This report uses XML [<a href="tr20-6.html#xml10">XML</a>] as a prominent and general
example of markup. The XML namespace notation [<a
href="tr20-6.html#Namespace">Namespace</a>] is used to indicate that a certain element
is taken from a specific markup language. As an example, the prefix 'xhtml:'
indicates that this element is taken from [<a href="tr20-6.html#XHTML">XHTML</a>]. This
means that the examples containing the namespace prefix 'xhtml:' are assumed
to include a namespace declaration of xmlns:xhtml="..." </p>

<p>Characters are denoted using the notation used in the Unicode Standard,
i.e. an optional U+ followed by their hexadecimal number, using at least 4
digits, such as "U+1234" or "U+10FFFD". In XML or HTML this could be
expressed as "&amp;#x1234;" or "&amp;#x10FFFD;".</p>

<h2><a name="General">2. General Considerations</a></h2>

<p>There are several general points to consider when looking at the
interaction between character encoding and markup. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Linearity of text vs. hierarchy of markup structure</li>
  <li>Overlap of control codes and markup semantics</li>
  <li>Markup <i>vs.</i> Styling</li>
  <li>Coincidence of semantic markup and functions </li>
  <li>Extensibility of markup</li>
</ul>

<h3 align="left"><a name="Linearity">2.1 Linearity versus Structure</a></h3>

<p align="left">Encoding text as a sequence of characters without further
information leads to a linear sequence, commonly called plain text. Character
follows character, without any particular structure. Markup, on the other
hand, defines a hierarchical structure for the text or data. In the case of
XML and most other, similar markup languages, the markup defines a tree
structure. While this tree structure is linearized for transmission in the
XML document, once the document has been parsed, the tree is available
directly.</p>

<p align="left">Operations that are easy to perform on trees are often
difficult to perform on linear sequences and vice versa. By separating
functionality between character encoding and markup appropriately, the
architecture becomes simpler, more powerful and longer-lasting.</p>

<p align="left">In particular, operations on hierarchical structures can
easily make sure that information is kept in context. Attributes assigned to
parts of a document are moved together with the associated part of the
document. Assigning an attribute to a part of a document limits the scope of
the attribute to that part of the document. Performing the same operations on
linear sequences of characters using control codes to set attributes and to
delimit their scope requires much more work and is error prone. Locating the
start or end of a span of text of the same attribute requires scanning
backwards and forwards for the embedded delimiter or control code. Moving or
editing text often results in mismatched control codes, so that an attribute
might suddenly apply to text it was not intended for.</p>

<h3 align="left"><a name="Overlap">2.2 Overlap of Control Code and Markup
Semantics</a></h3>

<p align="left">When markup is not available, plain text may require control
characters. This is usually the case where plain text must contain some
scoping or attribute information in order to be legible, <i>i.e.</i> to be
able to transmit the same content between originator and receiver. Many of
these control characters have direct equivalents in particular markup
languages, since markup handles these concerns efficiently. If both
characters and their markup equivalents may be present in the same text, the
question of priority is raised. Therefore it is important to identify and
resolve these ambiguities at the time markup is first applied.</p>

<h3 align="left"><a name="Markup">2.3 Markup and Styling</a></h3>

<p align="left">Besides the basic character encoding and text markup there is
a third contributor to text functionality, namely styling. Markup is
concerned with the logical structure of the text or data, <i>e.g. </i>to
indicate sections, subsections, and headers in a document, or to indicate the
various fields of an address record. Styling is used to present the
information in various ways, <i>e.g.</i> in different fonts, different type
styles (italic, bold), different colors, <i>etc. </i>Some character codes do
not encode a generic character, but a styled character. Where these
characters are used, styling information is frozen, <i>i.e.</i> it is no
longer possible to alter the appearance of the text by applying style
information. However, there are many examples where a historically free
stylistic variation has over time become a semantic distinction that is
properly encoded as plain text. Sometimes, what is a free variation in some
contexts, implies strict semantic differentiation in others. In all such
instances, altering the appearance of the text by styling information would
irreparably alter the content of the text.</p>

<h3 align="left"><a name="Coincidence">2.4 Coincidence of Markup and
Functions</a></h3>

<p align="left">Dealing with various functionalities on the markup level has
the additional advantage that in most cases, text portions that need some
particular attribute (or styling) are actually those text portions identified
by markup. A paragraph may be in French, a citation may need a bidi
embedding, a keyword may be in italics, a list number may be circled,
<i>etc.</i>. This makes it very efficient to associate those attributes with
markup.</p>

<p align="left">However, where local or point-like functionality is needed,
markup is <i>not</i> very efficient and its main benefit, easy manipulation
of scope, is not required. On the contrary, the intrusion of markup in the
middle of words can make search or sort operations more difficult. For these
cases expressing the information as character codes is not only a viable, but
often the preferred alternative, which needs to be considered in the design
of markup languages.</p>

<h3 align="left"><a name="Extensibility">2.5 Extensibility of Markup</a></h3>

<p align="left">Character encoding works with a range of integers used as
character codes. This is extremely efficient, but has some limitations.
Markup, on the other hand, is much more extensible. Using technologies such
as XML Namespaces [<a href="tr20-6.html#Namespace">Namespace</a>], various vocabularies
can be mixed.</p>

<h2><a name="Charlist">3. Suitability of Characters in Markup</a></h2>

<p>This section discusses the suitability of Unicode characters for use in
markup, with particular emphasis to format characters, as well as characters
that have been deprecated.</p>

<p>There are characters which are unsuitable in the context of markup in
XML/HTML and whose use is discouraged, because one or more of the following
conditions apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are deprecated in the Unicode Standard.</li>
  <li>They are unsupportable without additional data.</li>
  <li>They are difficult to handle because they are stateful.</li>
  <li>They are better handled by markup.</li>
  <li>They are undesirable because of conflict with equivalent markup.</li>
</ul>

<p>Section 3.1 provides a list of such characters. Section 3.2 provides a
list of format characters that are suitable for use with markup. Sections 3.3
through 3.10 discuss in more detail the following points for the discouraged
characters.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Short description of semantics</li>
  <li>Reason for inclusion in Unicode</li>
  <li>Specific problems when used with markup</li>
  <li>Other areas where problems may occur (<i>e.g.</i> plain text)</li>
  <li>What kind of markup to use instead</li>
  <li>What to do if detected in a particular context</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Suitable">3.1 Characters not Suitable for use With
Markup</a></h3>

<p>The following table contains the characters currently considered not
suitable for use with markup in XML or HTML. (See however the <a
href="tr20-6.html#Note">note</a> in the <a href="tr20-6.html#Introduction">Introduction</a>.) They
may also be unsuitable for other markup or page layout languages. For
determining possible conflict this report uses the markup available in
HTML.</p>

<h3><a name="Line">3.3 Line and Paragraph Separator, U+2028..U+2029</a></h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: The line and paragraph separator provide
unambiguous means to denote hard line breaks and paragraph delimiters in
plain text.</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters were introduced into the
Unicode Standard to overcome the ambiguous and widely divergent use of
control codes for this purpose. See Unicode Technical Report #13, Unicode
Newline Guidelines <a href="tr20-6.html#UTR9">[UAX13]</a>.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Including these characters in
markup text does not work where it would duplicate the existing markup
commands for delimiting paragraphs and lines.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The separator characters can also
problematic when used in plain text, because legacy data is usually converted
code point for code point into Unicode and all receivers of Unicode plain
text have to effectively be able to interpret the existing use of control
codes for this purpose. As a result, fewer Unicode implementations support
these characters, than would be the case otherwise.</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: In HTML, use &lt;xhtml:br /&gt; instead of
U+2028 and surround paragraphs by &lt;xhtml:p&gt; and &lt;/xhtml:p&gt;
instead of separating them with U+2029.</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: In a browser context, treat as
whitespace. When received in an editing context, replace the character by the
corresponding markup. </p>

<h3><a name="Bidi">3.4 Bidi Embedding Controls (LRE, RLE, LRO, RLO, PDF),
U+202A .. U+202E</a></h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: The bidi embedding controls are required to
supplement the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm in plain text</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: The Unicode Bidirectional algorithm
unambiguously resolves the display direction for bidirectional text. It does
so by assigning all characters directional categories and then resolving
these in context. In a small number of circumstances this <i>implicit </i>
method does not produce satisfactory results and embedding controls are
needed to ensure that sender and receiver agree on the display direction for
a given text. See Unicode Technical Report # 9, The Bidirectional Algorithm
<a href="tr20-6.html#UTR9">[UAX 9]</a>.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters duplicate
available markup, which is better suited to handle the stateful nature of
their effect. </p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The embedding controls introduce a
state into the plain text, which must be maintained when editing or
displaying the text. Processes that are modifying the text without being
aware of this state may inadvertently affect the rendering of large portions
of the text, for example by removing a PDF.</p>

<p>For details on bidi markup, please see Section 8.2 of HTML [<a
href="tr20-6.html#HTML4.0-8.2">HMTL 4.0-8.2</a>]. The text of HTML 4.0 gives this
recommendation: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Using HTML directionality markup with Unicode
  characters.</strong> Authors and designers of authoring software should be
  aware that conflicts can arise if the <a

  bidirectional HTML text with a simple text editor, but some software may be
  more apt at using the<a rel="biblioentry" href="tr20-6.html#Unicode" class="normref">
  [UNICODE]</a> characters. If both methods are used, great care should be
  exercised to insure proper nesting of markup and directional embedding or
  override, otherwise, rendering results are undefined.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This document goes beyond HTML and recommends that <i>only</i> the markup
should be used.</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: In a browser context, ignore. When
received in an editing context, replace the characters by the appropriate
markup. </p>

<h3><a name="Deprecated">3.5<em> </em>Deprecated Formatting Characters,
U+206A..U+206F</a></h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: These characters are deprecated. They were
originally intended to allow explicit activation of contextual shaping,
numeric digit rendering and symmetric swapping.</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters were retained from draft
versions of ISO 10646.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: The processing model for these
characters is not supported in markup.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The Unicode Standard requires that
symmetric swapping, contextual shaping, and alternate digit shapes are
enabled by default and no longer supports inhibiting any of them by use of
these character codes. The most likely effect of their occurrence in
generated text would be that of a 'garbage' character.</p>

<p><em>Conversion for use with markup</em>: Apply the appropriate conversion
to bring the data stream in line with the Unicode text model for
bidirectional text and cursively-connected scripts.</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: When received by a browser as part of
marked up text, they may be ignored. When received in an editing context,
they may be removed, possibly with a warning. Alternatively, an appropriate
conversion from the legacy text model may be provided. This will most likely
be limited to applications directly interfacing with and knowledgeable of the
particular legacy implementation that inspired these characters.</p>

<h3><a name="BOM">3.6 Byte Order Mark, ZWNBSP, U+FEFF</a></h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: U+FEFF has two funtions. It is formally known
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">zero width no-break space</span>
(ZWNBSP), and can act as a word joiner, but its primary use is as <i>byte
order mark</i>, to indicate in a file signature that a file is in a Unicode
encoding form and of a particular byte order. The use as word joiner is
deprecated for use in new data as of [<a href="tr20-6.html#Unicode32">Unicode3.2</a>] in
favor of U+2060 WORD JOINER. The use as byte order mark remains
unaffected.</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: Originally included in Unicode for the sole
purpose of indicating byte order or use in file signatures, the character
acquired the ZWNBSP semantics as part of the merger between ISO/IEC 10646 and
Unicode. When used as a byte order mark the character is placed at the
beginning of a file. If a recipient views it as FEFF then the byte order
between sender and receiver match. If the recipient views it as FFFE (a
non-character code point) then the sender used opposite byte order from the
recipient, and the recipient needs to convert the byte order or refuse to
read the file. When used as a ZWBSP the character is intended to prevent
breaks between adjacent characters. This function is now provided by U+2060
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">zero width word joiner </span>(ZWJ)
making it unnecessary to insert U+FEFF in the middle of a file. For more
information see [<a href="tr20-6.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] and [<a
href="tr20-6.html#Unicode32">Unicode32</a>].</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Using U+FEFF as ZWNBSP makes it
impossible to distinguish it from the case where a byte order mark was left
in the middle of a file inadvertently due to incorrect splicing.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The use of byte order mark as ZWNBSP is
also problematic when used in plain text, and is not intended for that
purpose. The use of U+FEFF in file signatures to indicate byte order is the
only recommended use of this character.</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: None.</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>:  When received by a browser as part of
marked-up text, treat depending on location. At the head of a file, treat as
byte order mark (i.e. as part of the character encoding, not as part of the
parsed character stream, see e.g. Section 4.3.3 of <a href="tr20-6.html#xml10">[XML
1.0]</a>). Otherwise, assume it is older data using it as ZWNBSP. When
receiving plain text in an editing environment, editors may take one or more
of several actions: replace ZWNBSP in the middle of a file with ZWJ or issue
a warning to the user.</p>

<h3><a name="Interlinear">3.7 Interlinear Annotation Characters,
U+FFF9-U+FFFB</a></h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: The interlinear annotation characters are used
to delimit interlinear annotations in certain circumstances. They are
intended to provide text anchors and delimiters for interlinear annotation
for in-process use and are not intended for interchange.</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: The interlinear annotation characters were
included in Unicode only in order to reserve code points for very frequent
application-internal use. The interlinear annotation characters are used to
delimit interlinear annotations in contexts where other delimiters are not
available, and where non-textual means exist to carry formatting information.
Many text-processing applications store the text and the associated markup
(or in some cases styling information) of a document in separate structures.
The actual text is kept in a single linear structure; additional information
is kept separately with pointers to the appropriate text positions. This is
called out-of-band information. The overall implementation makes sure that
these two structures are kept in sync. If the text contains interlinear
annotations, it is extremely helpful for implementations to have delimiters
in the text itself; even though delimiters are not otherwise used for style
markup. With this method, and unlike the case of the object replacement
character, all textual information can remain in the standard text stream,
but any additional formatting information is kept separately. In addition,
the Interlinear Annotation Anchor serves as a placeholder for formatting
information for the whole annotation object, the same way a paragraph mark
can be a placeholder to attach paragraph formatting information.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Including interlinear annotation
characters in marked-up text does not work because the additional formatting
information (how to position the annotation,...) is not available.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The interlinear annotation characters
are also problematic when used in plain text, and are not intended for that
purpose. In particular, on older display systems that simply ignore or
replace the Interlinear Annotation Characters, the meaning of the text may be
changed.</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: The markup to be used in place of the
Interlinear Annotation Characters depends on the formatting and nature of the
interlinear annotation in question. For ruby, please see [<a
href="tr20-6.html#Ruby">Ruby</a>].</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>:  When received by a browser as part of
marked-up text, they may be ignored. When receiving plain text in an editing
environment, editors may take one or more of several actions: remove U+FFF9
together with removing all characters between U+FFFA and following U+FFFB, 
ignore U+FFF9 and turn U+FFFA and U+FFFB  to "[" and "]" respectively, issue
a warning to the user, or tentatively convert into appropriate ruby markup
for further editing and formatting by the user.</p>

<h3><a name="Object">3.8 Object Replacement Character, U+FFFC</a></h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: The object replacement character is used to
stand in place of an object (e.g. an image) included in a text.</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: The object replacement character was
included in Unicode only in order to reserve a codepoint for a very frequent
application-internal use. Many text-processing applications store the text
and the associated markup (or in some cases styling information) of a
document in separate structures. The actual text is kept in a single linear
structure; additional information is kept separately with pointers to the
appropriate text positions. The overall implementation makes sure that these
two structures are kept in sync. If the text contains objects such as images,
it is extremely helpful for implementations to have a sentinel in the text
itself; any additional information is kept separately.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Including an object replacement
character in markup text does not work because the additional information
(what object to include,...) is not available.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The object replacement character is
also problematic when used in plain text, because there is no way in plain
text to provide the actual object information or a reference to it.</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: The markup to be used in place of the Object
Replacement Character depends on the object in question and the markup
context it is used in. Typical cases are &lt;xhtml:img src='...' /&gt;,
&lt;xhtml:object ...&gt;, or &lt;xhtml:applet ...&gt;. These constructs allow
providing all additional information needed to identify and use the object in
question.</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: Browsers may ignore this character. When
received in an editing context, if the actual object is accessible, editors
may either replace the character by the appropriate markup for that object,
or otherwise remove it, ideally providing a warning.</p>

<h3><a name="Musical">3.9 Musical Controls</a>, U+1D173..U+1D17A</h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: A series of characters for controlling scope
in musical notation.</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters designate the start and
end of common musical constructs. Full musical layout depends on additional
information, for example pitch, that cannot be encoded using Unicode.
However, many musical symbols may be depicted in isolation (and without
assigning pitch) as part of a textual discussion of music. Plain text use of
Unicode characters is primarily intended for this latter purpose. The scoping
operators can be used to support limited renderings of beams, slurs, phrases,
etc. in this context. However, in the context of markup languages, musical
scoring calls for a dedicated markup language (analogous to MathML) which
would be expected to contain markup for these constructs.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters duplicate
information that can in principle be expressed in markup.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: Their special code range allows them to
be easily filtered, but applications that do not expect them will treat them
as garbage characters.</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: Replace with equivalent markup if
available.</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: Browsers may ignore these characters.
When received in an editing context, editors may remove or replace them by
equivalent markup.</p>

<h3><a name="Language">3.10 Language Tag Characters</a>, U+E0000 ..
U+E007F</h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: A series of characters for expressing language
tags, based on existing standards for language tags using the rules in [<a
href="tr20-6.html#Unicode31">Unicode31</a>].</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters allow in-band language
tagging in situations where full markup is not available, while allowing easy
filtering by applications that do not support them. They were solely included
for the benefit of those Internet protocols, such as ACAP, which require a
standard mechanism for marking language in UTF-8 strings, and at the same
time to avoid the use of other tagging schemes that relied on specific
details of the encoding form used.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters duplicate
information that can be expressed in markup.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: Their special code range allows them to
be easily filtered, but applications that do not expect them will treat them
as garbage characters.</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: Replace with equivalent language markup. XML
and XHTML have the xml:lang attribute. HTML has the lang attribute. These
attributes follow different scoping rules than the tag characters, therefore
this replacement will generally not be a simple 1:1 substitution.</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: Browsers may ignore these characters.
When received in an editing context, editors may remove or replace them by
equivalent markup.</p>

<h2><a name="Compatibility">4. Characters with Compatibility Mappings</a></h2>

<p>The Unicode Standard provides compatibility mappings for a number of
characters. Compatibility mappings indicate a relationship to another
character, but the exact nature of the relationship varies. In some cases the
relationship means "is based on" in some other cases it denotes a property.
When plain text is marked up, it may make sense to map some of these
characters to their compatibility equivalents <em>and</em> suitable markup.
It is important to understand the nature of the distinctions between
characters and their compatibility equivalents and the context in where these
distinctions matter. It is never advisable to apply compatibility mappings
indiscriminately. This section provides guidance on when and how to apply
compatibility mappings in the case of importing text from non-XML
(non-marked-up) sources. The section is organized by the "compatibility tag"
associated with each compatibility mapping.</p>

<h3><a name="Overview">4.1 Overview</a></h3>

<p>The following table gives an overview of the various compatibility
characters, organized by "compatibility tag". The first column contains the
tag value of the "compatibility tag" from the Unicode Character Database [<a
href="tr20-6.html#UnicodeData">UnicodeData</a>]. Although these tags use "&lt;" and
"&gt;", they do not appear as such in markup and should not be confused with
XML tags. <em>Code range</em> indicates which code points the entry applies
to. The entry in the Action column summarizes the recommended action to be
taken whenever markup is first applied to non-XML text. Each entry indicates
whether the characters can be substituted using the compatibility equivalent
according to Normalization Form KC of [<a href="tr20-6.html#UTR15">UAX 15</a>], can be
replaced by equivalent markup where available, or should be retained. For
some cases, instead of or in addition to markup, style information [<a
href="tr20-6.html#css2">CSS2</a>] is needed. <i>Description and usage</i> provides
additional information. Sections 4.3 through 4.6 provide additional
information for some of these sets of compatibility characters including
detailed recommended actions.</p>

<p><b>Notes:</b></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>*Use normalization form KC for these particular characters. <br>
  **Some symbols used in vertical layout may also become accessible via list
  item marker style(s).<br>
  ***At the time of this writing there is no appropriate markup for squared
  kana clusters or horizontal in vertical symbols.</p>

<h3><a name="Generating">4.2 Generating New Text</a></h3>

<p>Presentation forms and characters for which adequate representation exists
as marked up text should never be entered into new data. However, many of the
characters with &lt;font&gt; tag are suitable for new data, as long as they
are used in the manner they are intended, that is as symbols, with definite
semantic differentiation between the different forms. However, they must not
be used to create the appearance of styled text. On the other hand, text
styles should not be used to carry the essential semantic distinction needed,
for example for mathematics.</p>

<p>For example to write <i>hello,</i> one should use &lt;i&gt;hello&lt;/i&gt;
and not the sequence of Unicode characters U+210E, U+212F, U+2113, U+2113,
U+2134. Conversely, to indicate <i>Planck's constant</i> one should use
U+210E and not &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;.</p>

<h3><a name="List">4.3 List Item Marker Characters</a></h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: Characters with a &lt;circled&gt; tag or
characters with &lt;compat&gt; tag and compatibility mapping to a
parenthesized string.</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: They are most frequently used for marking
enumerated list items, but the characters with a &lt;circled&gt; tag often
occur as dingbats or footnote markers in tables. The same characters are used
in regular text when citing an item from a numbered list.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters do not cause undue
interaction with markup</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: None</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: (list item style) When generating marked up
text these characters occur only internal to the user agent when list item
styles are rendered. When marking up plain text data they could be converted
to suitable list item styles, if such use can be properly inferred. However,
it is often necessary to refer to numbered or lettered list item markers in
the text.</p>

<p>Compatibility mappings of the form (<em>n</em>) or (<em>n</em>.) can be
kept as single characters, or replaced by list item marker styles. A
conversion to list item marker styles allows a simple extension of the set to
arbitrary numbers. This is in contrast to circled characters: Support to
properly generate arbitrary circled numbers is not commonly available,
therefore conversion to list item marker styles does not easily allow an
extension of the set of accessible circled numbers.</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action needs to be taken by browsers.
When received in an editing context, substitution of a list item marker style
may be appropriate. However, the same characters are very often used as
dingbat-like symbols in tables, or may appear in general text, when referring
to an item from a list. Therefore the user must have the choice of whether to
replace the character.</p>

<h3><a name="Fractions">4.4 Fractions</a></h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: Single character fractions such as ½ or ¼.</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: Subsets of these occur in practically all
legacy character sets.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: The repertoire is limited to a few
common fractions. When used with more general methods of generating fractions
such as MathML [<a href="tr20-6.html#MathML">MathML</a>] the usual problem of dual
representation arises.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: Other than normalization issues, these
characters present no undue problems in plain text. Where fraction slash is
supported, these can be expressed by substituting their compatibility
mappings.</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: MathML.</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action needs to be taken by browsers
or editors, except when converting plain text to MathML.</p>

<h3><a name="Squared">4.5 Squared or Horizontal</a></h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: Characters that are symbols composed of groups
of typically kana or Latin letters, digits plus slash for use in a single
display cell in vertical display of text. </p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: Many existing character sets contain these
as precomposed characters since for simple implementations this is the only
way to support the common use of providing metric units and other
abbreviations in a single character cell for vertical text layout. </p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Proposed markup, including CSS
styling, would be able express an unbounded set of these abbreviations,
obviating the need of cataloguing these in the character encoding standard
and making them more directly accessible to text based processing, for
example searching.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The repertoire of these legacy
characters is limited; many more combinations are in actual use than are
accounted for in character sets. Pre-composed symbols do not make their text
content available to search engines. They also require re-encoding for text
laid out horizontally.</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: The style property text-combine in the
<cite>CSS3 module: text</cite> Working Draft [<a
href="tr20-6.html#CSS3Text">CSS3Text</a>].</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action required. (Subject to change
pending the outcome of current proposals.)</p>

<h3><a name="Superscripts">4.6 Superscripts and Subscripts</a></h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: Mainly super and subscript digits, but also
signs, parens and some letters.</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: Super and subscript characters occur in
many legacy character sets, including Latin-1. Their use in pure plain text
is common for databases, e.g. including metric units for part descriptions 
(viz. cm<sup>2</sup>) or (usually simplified) formulae as occur in titles of
scientific publications. Super and subscripted letters and digits are common
in some forms of phonetic or phonemic transcriptions.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Using these characters directly in
markup provides an alternate representation compared to marked up text,
leading to different treatment by search engines. However, when super and
sub-scripts are to reflect semantic distinctions, it is easier to work with
these meanings encoded in text rather than markup, for example, in phonetic
or phonemic transcription.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: none</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>:&lt;xhtml:sup&gt; and &lt;xhtml:sub&gt; or
&lt;mathml:msup&gt; and &lt;mathml:msub&gt;</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action required by browsers. When
received in an editing context, substitute the corresponding markup.</p>

<h3><a name="Other">4.7 Other Characters Marked &lt;compat&gt;</a></h3>

<p><em>Short description</em>: The &lt;compat&gt; label was given to a set of
compatibility characters whose further classification was not settled at the
time the standard was created. The largest components are list item marker
characters.</p>

<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters occur in many legacy
character sets.</p>

<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: none. There usually is no
equivalent markup.</p>

<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: none</p>

<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: none.</p>

<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action required.</p>
