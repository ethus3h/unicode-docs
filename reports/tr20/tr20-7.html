<h2><a name="Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The Unicode Standard&nbsp; [<a href="tr20-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] defines the
universal character set. Its primary goal is to provide an unambiguous encoding
of the content of plain text, ultimately covering all languages in the world.
Currently in its fourth major version, Unicode contains a large number of
characters covering most of the currently used scripts in the world. It also
contains additional characters for interoperability with older character
encodings, and characters with control-like functions included primarily for
reasons of providing unambiguous interpretation of plain text. Unicode provides
specifications for use of all of these characters.</p>
<p>For document and data interchange, the Internet and the World Wide Web are
more and more making use of marked-up text such as <a href="tr20-7.html#html40">HTML</a>
and <a href="tr20-7.html#xml10">XML</a>. In many instances, markup provides the same, or
essentially similar features to those provided by format characters in the
Unicode Standard for use in plain text. Another special character category
provided by Unicode are compatibility characters. While there may be valid
reasons to support these characters and their specifications in plain text,
their use in marked-up text can conflict with the rules of the markup language.
Formatting characters are discussed in chapters <a href="tr20-7.html#General">2</a> and <a href="tr20-7.html#Charlist">3</a>,
compatibility characters in chapter <a href="tr20-7.html#Compatibility">4</a>.</p>
<p>Issues resulting from canonical equivalences and Normalization [<a href="tr20-7.html#UTR15">Normalization</a>]
as well as the interaction of character encoding and methods of escaping
characters in markup are discussed in the Character Model for the World Wide Web
[<a href="tr20-7.html#Charmod">Charmod</a>].</p>
<p>The issues of using Unicode characters with marked-up text depend to some
degree on the rules of the markup language in question and the set of elements
it contains. In a narrow sense, this document concerns itself only with XML, and
to some extent HTML. However, much of the general information presented here
should be useful in a broader context, including some page layout languages.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b><a name="Note">Note:</a></b> Many of the recommendations of this report
  depend on the availability of particular markup or styling. Where possible,
  appropriate DTDs or Schemas should be used or designed to make such markup or
  styling available, or the DTDs or Schemas used should be appropriately
  extended. The current version of this document makes no specific
  recommendations for the design of DTDs or Schemas, or for the use of
  particular DTDs or Schemas, but the information presented here may be useful
  to designers of DTDs and Schemas, and to people selecting DTDs or Schemas for
  their applications. The recommendations of this report do not apply in the
  case of XML used for blind data transport and similar cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="Notation">1.1 Notation</a></h3>
<p>This report uses XML [<a href="tr20-7.html#xml10">XML</a>] as a prominent and general
example of markup. The XML namespace notation [<a href="tr20-7.html#Namespace">Namespace</a>]
is used to indicate that a certain element is taken from a specific markup
language. As an example, the prefix 'xhtml:' indicates that this element is
taken from [<a href="tr20-7.html#XHTML">XHTML</a>]. This means that the examples containing
the namespace prefix 'xhtml:' are assumed to include a namespace declaration of
xmlns:xhtml=&quot;...&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Characters are denoted using the notation used in the Unicode Standard, i.e.
an optional U+ followed by their hexadecimal number, using at least 4 digits,
such as &quot;U+1234&quot; or &quot;U+10FFFD&quot;. In XML or HTML this could be
expressed as &quot;&amp;#x1234;&quot; or &quot;&amp;#x10FFFD;&quot;.</p>
<h2><a name="General">2. General Considerations</a></h2>
<p>There are several general points to consider when looking at the interaction
between character encoding and markup.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Linearity of text vs. hierarchy of markup structure</li>
  <li>Overlap of control codes and markup semantics</li>
  <li>Markup <i>vs.</i> Styling</li>
  <li>Coincidence of semantic markup and functions&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Extensibility of markup</li>
</ul>
<h3 align="left"><a name="Linearity">2.1 Linearity versus Structure</a></h3>
<p align="left">Encoding text as a sequence of characters without further
information leads to a linear sequence, commonly called plain text. Character
follows character, without any particular structure. Markup, on the other hand,
defines a hierarchical structure for the text or data. In the case of XML and
most other, similar markup languages, the markup defines a tree structure. While
this tree structure is linearized for transmission in the XML document, once the
document has been parsed, the tree is available directly.</p>
<p align="left">Operations that are easy to perform on trees are often difficult
to perform on linear sequences and vice versa. By separating functionality
between character encoding and markup appropriately, the architecture becomes
simpler, more powerful and longer-lasting.</p>
<p align="left">In particular, operations on hierarchical structures can easily
make sure that information is kept in context. Attributes assigned to parts of a
document are moved together with the associated part of the document. Assigning
an attribute to a part of a document limits the scope of the attribute to that
part of the document. Performing the same operations on linear sequences of
characters using control codes to set attributes and to delimit their scope
requires much more work and is error prone. Locating the start or end of a span
of text of the same attribute requires scanning backwards and forwards for the
embedded delimiter or control code. Moving or editing text often results in
mismatched control codes, so that an attribute might suddenly apply to text it
was not intended for.</p>
<h3 align="left"><a name="Overlap">2.2 Overlap of Control Code and Markup
Semantics</a></h3>
<p align="left">When markup is not available, plain text may require control
characters. This is usually the case where plain text must contain some scoping
or attribute information in order to be legible, <i>i.e.</i> to be able to
transmit the same content between originator and receiver. Many of these control
characters have direct equivalents in particular markup languages, since markup
handles these concerns efficiently. If both characters and their markup
equivalents may be present in the same text, the question of priority is raised.
Therefore it is important to identify and resolve these ambiguities at the time
markup is first applied.</p>
<h3 align="left"><a name="Markup">2.3 Markup and Styling</a></h3>
<p align="left">Besides the basic character encoding and text markup there is a
third contributor to text functionality, namely styling. Markup is concerned
with the logical structure of the text or data, <i>e.g. </i>to indicate
sections, subsections, and headers in a document, or to indicate the various
fields of an address record. Styling is used to present the information in
various ways, <i>e.g.</i> in different fonts, different type styles (italic,
bold), different colors, <i>etc. </i>Some character codes do not encode a
generic character, but a styled character. Where these characters are used,
styling information is frozen, <i>i.e.</i> it is no longer possible to alter the
appearance of the text by applying style information. However, there are many
examples where a historically free stylistic variation has over time become a
semantic distinction that is properly encoded as plain text. Sometimes, what is
a free variation in some contexts, implies strict semantic differentiation in
others. In all such instances, altering the appearance of the text by styling
information would irreparably alter the content of the text.</p>
<h3 align="left"><a name="Coincidence">2.4 Coincidence of Markup and Functions</a></h3>
<p align="left">Dealing with various functionalities on the markup level has the
additional advantage that in most cases, text portions that need some particular
attribute (or styling) are actually those text portions identified by markup. A
paragraph may be in French, a citation may need a bidi embedding, a keyword may
be in italics, a list number may be circled, <i>etc.</i>. This makes it very
efficient to associate those attributes with markup.</p>
<p align="left">However, where local or point-like functionality is needed,
markup is <i>not</i> very efficient and its main benefit, easy manipulation of
scope, is not required. On the contrary, the intrusion of markup in the middle
of words can make search or sort operations more difficult. For these cases
expressing the information as character codes is not only a viable, but often
the preferred alternative, which needs to be considered in the design of markup
languages.</p>
<h3 align="left"><a name="Extensibility">2.5 Extensibility of Markup</a></h3>
<p align="left">Character encoding works with a range of integers used as
character codes. This is extremely efficient, but has some limitations. Markup,
on the other hand, is much more extensible. Using technologies such as XML
Namespaces [<a href="tr20-7.html#Namespace">Namespace</a>], various vocabularies can be
mixed.</p>
<h3><a name="Suitability">2.6 Suitability of Characters in Markup</a></h3>
<p>The suitability of a particular character for markup depends on its status in
the Unicode Standard, the nature of its behavior in text and the availability of
equivalent markup. Many format characters that are needed for advanced plain
text are not suitable for use with markup. <a href="tr20-7.html#Suitable">Section 3</a>
gives a list and detailed descriptions. However, not all format characters are
unsuitable for use with markup. <a href="tr20-7.html#Format">Section 4</a> provides a list
of format characters that are suitable for use with markup and gives some
discussion about their use. In addition to format characters, the Unicode
Standard also has compatibility characters, some of which may be replaceable by
suitable markup. These characters are discussed in <a href="tr20-7.html#Compatibility">Section
5</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Suitable">3 Characters not Suitable for use With Markup</a></h2>
<p>There are characters which are unsuitable in the context of markup in
XML/HTML and whose use is discouraged, because one or more of the following
conditions apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are deprecated in the Unicode Standard.</li>
  <li>They are unsupportable without additional data.</li>
  <li>They are difficult to handle because they are stateful.</li>
  <li>They are better handled by markup.</li>
  <li>They are undesirable because of conflict with equivalent markup.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="tr20-7.html#Charlist">Section 3.1</a> provides a list of such characters.
Sections <a href="tr20-7.html#Line">3.2</a> through <a href="tr20-7.html#Language">3.9</a> discuss in
more detail the following points for the discouraged characters.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Short description of semantics</li>
  <li>Reason for inclusion in Unicode</li>
  <li>Specific problems when used with markup</li>
  <li>Other areas where problems may occur (<i>e.g.</i> plain text)</li>
  <li>What kind of markup to use instead</li>
  <li>What to do if detected in a particular context</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Charlist">3.1 Table of Characters not Suitable for use With Markup</a></h3>
<p>The following table contains the characters currently considered not suitable
for use with markup in XML or HTML. (See however the <a href="tr20-7.html#Note">note</a> in
the <a href="tr20-7.html#Introduction">Introduction</a>.) They may also be unsuitable for
other markup or page layout languages.&nbsp;For determining possible conflict
this report uses the markup available in HTML.</p>

<p>Except for Line and Paragraph Separator, or the Byte Order Mark, it is
acceptable for browsers and similar user agents to ignore the presence of
discouraged characters in HTML or XML. It is up to authoring tools to ensure
proper conversion between these characters and equivalent markup where it
exists.</p>
<h3><a name="Line">3.2 Line and Paragraph Separator, U+2028..U+2029</a></h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: The line and paragraph separator provide
unambiguous means to denote hard line breaks and paragraph delimiters in plain
text.</p>
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters were introduced into the
Unicode Standard to overcome the ambiguous and widely divergent use of control
codes for this purpose. See Unicode Technical Report #13, Unicode Newline
Guidelines <a href="tr20-7.html#UTR9">[UAX13]</a>.</p>
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Including these characters in markup
text does not work where it would duplicate the existing markup commands for
delimiting paragraphs and lines.</p>
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The separator characters can also
problematic when used in plain text, because legacy data is usually converted
code point for code point into Unicode and all receivers of Unicode plain text
have to effectively be able to interpret the existing use of control codes for
this purpose. As a result, fewer Unicode implementations support these
characters, than would be the case otherwise.</p>
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: In HTML, use &lt;xhtml:br /&gt; instead of
U+2028 and surround paragraphs by &lt;xhtml:p&gt; and &lt;/xhtml:p&gt; instead
of separating them with U+2029.</p>
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: In a browser context, treat as whitespace.
When received in an editing context, replace the character by the corresponding
markup.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Bidi">3.3 Bidi Embedding Controls (LRE, RLE, LRO, RLO, PDF), U+202A

<p><em>Short description</em>: The bidi embedding controls are required to
supplement the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm in plain text</p>
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: The Unicode Bidirectional algorithm
unambiguously resolves the display direction for bidirectional text. It does so
by assigning all characters directional categories and then resolving these in
context. In a small number of circumstances this <i>implicit&nbsp;</i> method
does not produce satisfactory results and embedding controls are needed to
ensure that sender and receiver agree on the display direction for a given text.
See Unicode Technical Report #9, The Bidirectional Algorithm <a href="tr20-7.html#UTR9">[UAX
9]</a>.</p>
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters duplicate available
markup, which is better suited to handle the stateful nature of their
effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The embedding controls introduce a state
into the plain text, which must be maintained when editing or displaying the
text. Processes that are modifying the text without being aware of this state
may inadvertently affect the rendering of large portions of the text, for
example by removing a PDF.</p>

<p>For details on bidi markup, please see Section 8.2 of HTML [<a href="tr20-7.html#HTML4.0-8.2">HMTL
4.0-8.2</a>]. The text of HTML 4.0 gives this recommendation:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Using HTML directionality markup with Unicode characters.</strong>
  Authors and designers of authoring software should be aware that conflicts can
  arise if the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#adef-dir" class="noxref"><samp class="ainst">dir</samp></a>
  attribute is used on inline elements (including <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#edef-BDO" class="noxref"><samp class="einst">BDO</samp></a>)
  concurrently with the corresponding<a rel="biblioentry" href="tr20-7.html#Unicode" class="normref">
  [UNICODE]</a> formatting characters. Preferably one or the other should be
  used exclusively. The markup method offers a better guarantee of document
  structural integrity and alleviates some problems when editing bidirectional
  HTML text with a simple text editor, but some software may be more apt at
  using the<a rel="biblioentry" href="tr20-7.html#Unicode" class="normref"> [UNICODE]</a>
  characters. If both methods are used, great care should be exercised to insure
  proper nesting of markup and directional embedding or override, otherwise,
  rendering results are undefined.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This document goes beyond HTML and recommends that <i>only</i> the markup
should be used.</p>
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: In a browser context, ignore. When received
in an editing context, replace the characters by the appropriate markup.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Deprecated">3.4<em> </em>Deprecated Formatting Characters,
U+206A..U+206F</a></h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: These characters are deprecated. They were
originally intended to allow explicit activation of contextual shaping, numeric
digit rendering and symmetric swapping.</p>
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters were retained from draft
versions of ISO 10646.</p>
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: The processing model for these
characters is not supported in markup.</p>
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The Unicode Standard requires that
symmetric swapping, contextual shaping, and alternate digit shapes are enabled
by default and no longer supports inhibiting any of them by use of these
character codes. The most likely effect of their occurrence in generated text
would be that of a 'garbage' character.</p>
<p><em>Conversion for use with markup</em>: Apply the appropriate conversion to
bring the data stream in line with the Unicode text model for bidirectional text
and cursively-connected scripts.</p>
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: When received by a browser as part of marked
up text, they may be ignored. When received in an editing context, they may be
removed, possibly with a warning. Alternatively, an appropriate conversion from
the legacy text model may be provided. This will most likely be limited to
applications directly interfacing with and knowledgeable of the particular
legacy implementation that inspired these characters.</p>
<h3><a name="BOM">3.5 Byte Order Mark, ZWNBSP, U+FEFF</a></h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: U+FEFF has two functions. It is formally known as
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">zero width no-break space</span> (ZWNBSP),
and can act as a word joiner, but its primary use is as <i>byte order mark (BOM)</i>,
to indicate in a file signature that a file is in a Unicode encoding form and of
a particular byte order. Using U+FEFF as a word joiner in new data is
deprecated&nbsp; as of [<a href="tr20-7.html#Unicode32">Unicode3.2</a>] in favor of U+2060
WORD JOINER. The use as byte order mark remains unaffected.</p>
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: Originally included in Unicode for the sole
purpose of indicating byte order or use in file signatures, the character
acquired the ZWNBSP semantics as part of the merger between ISO/IEC 10646 and
Unicode. When used as a byte order mark the character is placed at the beginning
of a file. If a recipient views it as FEFF then the byte order between sender
and receiver match. If the recipient views it as FFFE (a non-character code
point) then the sender used opposite byte order from the recipient, and the
recipient needs to invert the byte order or refuse to read the file. When used
as a ZWBSP the character is intended to prevent breaks between adjacent
characters. This function is now provided by U+2060 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">zero
width word joiner </span>(ZWJ) making it unnecessary to insert U+FEFF in the
middle of a file. For more information see Chapter 15 of [<a href="tr20-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Using U+FEFF as ZWNBSP makes it
impossible to distinguish it from the case where a byte order mark was left in
the middle of a file inadvertently due to incorrect splicing.</p>
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The use of byte order mark as ZWNBSP is
also problematic when used in plain text, and has been deprecated for that
purpose in favor of U+2060 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">word joiner</span>.
The use of U+FEFF in file signatures to indicate byte order is the only
recommended use of this character.</p>
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: None.</p>
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>:&nbsp; When received by a browser as part of
marked-up text, treat depending on location. At the start of an external entity,
treat as byte order mark (i.e. as part of the character encoding, not as part of
the parsed character stream, see e.g. Section 4.3.3 of <a href="tr20-7.html#xml10">[XML
1.0]</a>). Otherwise, assume it is older data using it as ZWNBSP. When receiving
plain text in an editing environment, editors may take one or more of several
actions: replace ZWNBSP in the middle of a file with ZWJ or issue a warning to
the user.</p>
<h3><a name="Interlinear">3.6 Interlinear Annotation Characters, U+FFF9-U+FFFB</a></h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: The interlinear annotation characters are used to
delimit interlinear annotations in certain circumstances. They are intended to
provide text anchors and delimiters for interlinear annotation for in-process
use and are not intended for interchange.</p>
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: The interlinear annotation characters were
included in Unicode only in order to reserve code points for very frequent
application-internal use. The interlinear annotation characters are used to
delimit interlinear annotations in contexts where other delimiters are not
available, and where non-textual means exist to carry formatting information.
Many text-processing applications store the text and the associated markup (or
in some cases styling information) of a document in separate structures. The
actual text is kept in a single linear structure; additional information is kept
separately with pointers to the appropriate text positions. This is called
out-of-band information. The overall implementation makes sure that these two
structures are kept in sync. If the text contains interlinear annotations, it is
extremely helpful for implementations to have delimiters in the text itself;
even though delimiters are not otherwise used for style markup. With this
method, and unlike the case of the object replacement character, all textual
information can remain in the standard text stream, but any additional
formatting information is kept separately. In addition, the Interlinear
Annotation Anchor serves as a placeholder for formatting information for the
whole annotation object, the same way a paragraph mark can be a placeholder to
attach paragraph formatting information.</p>
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Including interlinear annotation
characters in marked-up text does not work because the additional formatting
information (how to position the annotation,...) is not available.</p>
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The interlinear annotation characters are
also problematic when used in plain text, and are not intended for that purpose.
In particular, on older display systems that simply ignore or replace the
Interlinear Annotation Characters, the meaning of the text may be changed.</p>
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: The markup to be used in place of the
Interlinear Annotation Characters depends on the formatting and nature of the
interlinear annotation in question. For ruby, please see [<a href="tr20-7.html#Ruby">Ruby</a>].</p>
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>:&nbsp; When received by a browser as part of
marked-up text, they may be ignored. When receiving plain text in an editing
environment, editors may take one or more of several actions: remove U+FFF9
together with removing all characters between U+FFFA and following U+FFFB;&nbsp;
ignore U+FFF9 and turn U+FFFA and U+FFFB&nbsp; into &quot;[&quot; and
&quot;]&quot; respectively, or into similar characters; issue a warning to the
user; or tentatively convert into appropriate ruby markup for further editing
and formatting by the user.</p>
<h3><a name="Object">3.7 Object Replacement Character, U+FFFC</a></h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: The object replacement character is used to stand
in place of an object (e.g. an image) included in a text.</p>
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: The object replacement character was included
in Unicode only in order to reserve a codepoint for a very frequent
application-internal use. Many text-processing applications store the text and
the associated markup (or in some cases styling information) of a document in
separate structures. The actual text is kept in a single linear structure;
additional information is kept separately with pointers to the appropriate text
positions. The overall implementation makes sure that these two structures are
kept in sync. If the text contains objects such as images, it is extremely
helpful for implementations to have a sentinel in the text itself; any
additional information is kept separately.</p>
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Including an object replacement
character in markup text does not work because the additional information (what
object to include,...) is not available.</p>
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The object replacement character is also
problematic when used in plain text, because there is no way in plain text to
provide the actual object information or a reference to it.</p>
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: The markup to be used in place of the Object
Replacement Character depends on the object in question and the markup context
it is used in. Typical cases are &lt;xhtml:img src='...' /&gt;, &lt;xhtml:object
...&gt;, or &lt;applet ...&gt;. These constructs allow providing all additional
information needed to identify and use the object in question.</p>
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: Browsers may ignore this character. When
received in an editing context, if the actual object is accessible, editors may
either replace the character by the appropriate markup for that object, or
otherwise remove it, ideally providing a warning.</p>
<h3><a name="Musical">3.8 Musical Controls</a>, U+1D173..U+1D17A</h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: A series of characters for controlling scope in
musical notation.</p>
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters designate the start and end
of common musical constructs. Full musical layout depends on additional
information, for example pitch, that cannot be encoded using Unicode. However,
many musical symbols may be depicted in isolation (and without assigning pitch)
as part of a textual discussion of music. Plain text use of Unicode characters
is primarily intended for this latter purpose. The scoping operators can be used
to support limited renderings of beams, slurs, phrases, etc. in this context.
However, in the context of markup languages, musical scoring calls for a
dedicated markup language (analogous to MathML) which would be expected to
contain markup for these constructs.</p>
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters duplicate information
that can in principle be expressed in markup.</p>
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: Their special code range allows them to be
easily filtered, but applications that do not expect them will treat them as
garbage characters.</p>
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: Replace with equivalent markup if available.</p>
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: Browsers may ignore these characters. When
received in an editing context, editors may remove or replace them by equivalent
markup.</p>
<h3><a name="Language">3.9 Language Tag Characters</a>, U+E0000 .. U+E007F</h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: A series of characters for expressing language
tags, based on existing standards for language tags using the rules in Chapter
15 of [<a href="tr20-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters allow in-band language
tagging in situations where full markup is not available, while allowing easy
filtering by applications that do not support them. They were solely included
for the benefit of those Internet protocols, such as ACAP, which require a
standard mechanism for marking language in UTF-8 strings, and at the same time
to avoid the use of other tagging schemes that relied on specific details of the
encoding form used.</p>
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters duplicate information
that can be expressed in markup.</p>
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: Their special code range allows them to be
easily filtered, but applications that do not expect them will treat them as
garbage characters.</p>
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: Replace with equivalent language markup. XML and
XHTML have the xml:lang attribute. HTML has the lang attribute. These attributes
follow different scoping rules than the tag characters, therefore this
replacement will generally not be a simple 1:1 substitution.</p>
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: Browsers may ignore these characters. When
received in an editing context, editors may remove or replace them by equivalent
markup.</p>
<h2><a name="Format">4 Format Characters Suitable for Use with Markup</a></h2>

</table>
<p>The following subsections briefly discuss some of the characters from the
above list, particularly those that affect more than their immediately adjacent
neighbors. Please see the Unicode Standard [<a href="tr20-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] for
full details.</p>
<h3><a name="Subtending">4.1 Subtending Marks</a></h3>
<p>Subtending marks are needed to represent a common feature in the Arabic and
Syriac scripts where a mark can be placed below a range of characters, for
example below a sequence of digits, to indicate a year. The Syriac abbreviation
mark is placed above a series of characters, making it technically a
supertending mark, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">ARABIC END OF
AYAH</span> is an enclosing mark. In the character stream, a subtending mark
precedes the affected characters. The end of affected range of characters is
defined implicitly, usually by the first non-alphanumeric character.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Unlike subtending marks, the scope of combining enclosing marks,
such as <span style="text-transform: uppercase; font-variant: small-caps">combining
enclosing circle,</span> is limited to the preceding default grapheme cluster.
For details on grapheme clusters see [<a href="tr20-7.html#UAX29">UAX 29</a>] <i>Text
Boundaries</i>.</p>
<p align="left">There is currently no existing markup that can represent the
scoping and layout functions defined by these characters, so they cannot be
substituted. It is unresolved to what degree intervening markup affects the
scope of these marks.</p>
<h3 align="left"><a name="Fraction">4.2 Fraction Slash</a></h3>
<p align="left">The fraction slash is used between sequences of decimal digits
to form fractions. Whether the resulting fraction has a horizontal or diagonal
fraction line is unspecified. The fallback is to leave the digits unchanged and
display a regular slash. In order to separate a digit from a following fraction,
as in 1<span style="font-size:3pt"> </span>¾, the use of <span style="font-variant: small-caps">U+2009
THIN SPACE</span> is recommended.</p>
<p align="left">For better control of fractions the use of [<a href="tr20-7.html#MathML">MathML</a>]
is suggested where appropriate.</p>
<h3><a name="Variation">4.3 Variation Selectors</a></h3>
<p>A variation selector is intended to cause a specific variant form (or range
of variant forms) when applied to a base character. For a variation selector to
have an effect it must immediately follow its base character. Only
pre-determined combinations of selected base characters and specific variation
selectors have a defined effect. All other combinations are ill-formed and are
to be ignored. The list of standardized combinations is documented in the
Unicode Character Database, see [<a href="tr20-7.html#Variants">Variants</a>]. In addition
to the 256 generic variation selectors, there are 3 Mogolan <i>free variation
selectors</i>. They function in all other ways like variation selectors, except
they only apply to base characters from the Mongolian script. Since Mongolian,
like Arabic, has positional character shapes, the variations are limited to
particular shaping contexts.</p>
<h3><a name="Ideographic">4.3 Ideographic Description Characters</a></h3>
<p>Ideographic Description Characters are included in the Unicode Standard as a
means to indicate the composition of ideographs from a combination of pieces,
where each piece in term is either a Unicode character or composed. Ordinarily
the result would be a human readable description of a character, perhaps one for
which a font is not available. However, at least some vendors are interested in
automatic conversion of these sequences into single ideographs.</p>
<h2><a name="Compatibility">5. Characters with Compatibility Mappings</a></h2>
<p>The Unicode Standard provides compatibility mappings for a number of
characters. Compatibility mappings indicate a relationship to another character,
but the exact nature of the relationship varies. In some cases the relationship
means &quot;is based on&quot; in some other cases it denotes a property. When
plain text is marked up, it may make sense to map some of these characters to
their compatibility equivalents <em>and</em> suitable markup. It is important to
understand the nature of the distinctions between characters and their
compatibility equivalents and the context in which these distinctions matter. It
is never advisable to apply compatibility mappings indiscriminately. This
section provides guidance on when and how to apply compatibility mappings in the
case of importing text from non-XML (non-marked-up) sources. The section is
organized by the &quot;compatibility tag&quot; associated with each
compatibility mapping.</p>
<h3><a name="Overview">5.1 Overview</a></h3>
<p>The following table gives an overview of the various compatibility
characters, organized by &quot;compatibility tag&quot;. The first column, <i>Tag
value,</i> contains the value of the &quot;compatibility tag&quot; from the
Unicode Character Database [<a href="tr20-7.html#UnicodeData">UnicodeData</a>]. Although
these tags use &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;, they do not appear as such
in markup and should not be confused with XML tags. <em>Code range</em>
indicates a further break down by code points. <i>Action</i> summarizes the

Each entry indicates whether the characters can be substituted using the
compatibility equivalent according to Normalization Form KC of [<a href="tr20-7.html#UTR15">UAX

retained. For some cases, instead of or in addition to markup, style information
[<a href="tr20-7.html#css2">CSS2</a>] is needed. <i>Description and usage</i> provides
additional information. Sections <a href="tr20-7.html#List">5.3</a> through <a href="tr20-7.html#Superscripts">5.6</a>

  <p><b>Note: </b>Some symbols used in vertical layout exist as single code

  display engines. See [<a href="tr20-7.html#CSS3Text">CSS3Text</a>] for proposed style

<h3><a name="Generating">5.2 Generating New Text</a></h3>
<p>Presentation forms and characters for which adequate representation exists as
marked up text should never be entered into new data. However, many of the
characters with &lt;font&gt; tag are suitable for new data, as long as they are
used in the manner they are intended, that is as symbols, with definite semantic
differentiation between the different forms. However, they must not be used to
create the appearance of styled text. On the other hand, text styles should not
be used to carry the essential semantic distinction needed, for example for
mathematics.</p>
<p>For example to write <i>hello,</i> one should use &lt;i&gt;hello&lt;/i&gt;
and not the sequence of Unicode characters U+210E, U+212F, U+2113, U+2113,
U+2134. Conversely, to indicate <i>Planck's constant</i> one should use U+210E
and not &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;.</p>
<h3><a name="List">5.3 List Item Marker Characters</a></h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: Characters with a &lt;circled&gt; tag or
characters with &lt;compat&gt; tag and compatibility mapping to a parenthesized
string.</p>
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: They are most frequently used for marking
enumerated list items, but the characters with a &lt;circled&gt; tag often occur
as dingbats or footnote markers in tables. The same characters are used in
regular text when citing an item from a numbered list.</p>
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters do not cause undue
interaction with markup</p>
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: None</p>
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: (list item style) When generating marked up text
these characters occur only internal to the user agent when list item styles are
rendered. When marking up plain text data they could be converted to suitable
list item styles, if such use can be properly inferred. However, it is often
necessary to refer to numbered or lettered list item markers in the text.</p>
<p>Compatibility mappings of the form (<em>n</em>) or (<em>n</em>.) can be kept
as single characters, or replaced by list item marker styles. A conversion to
list item marker styles allows a simple extension of the set to arbitrary
numbers. This is in contrast to circled characters: Support to properly generate
arbitrary circled numbers is not commonly available, therefore conversion to
list item marker styles does not easily allow an extension of the set of
accessible circled numbers.</p>
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action needs to be taken by browsers.
When received in an editing context, substitution of a list item marker style
may be appropriate. However, the same characters are very often used as
dingbat-like symbols in tables, or may appear in general text, when referring to
an item from a list. Therefore the user must have the choice of whether to
replace the character.</p>
<h3><a name="Fractions">5.4 Fractions</a></h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: Single character fractions such as ½ or ¼.</p>
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: Subsets of these occur in practically all
legacy character sets.</p>
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: The repertoire is limited to a few
common fractions. When used with more general methods of generating fractions
such as MathML [<a href="tr20-7.html#MathML">MathML</a>] the usual problem of dual
representation arises.</p>
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: Other than normalization issues, these
characters present no undue problems in plain text. Where fraction slash is
supported, these can be expressed by substituting their compatibility mappings.</p>
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: MathML.</p>
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action needs to be taken by browsers or
editors, except when converting plain text to MathML.</p>
<h3><a name="Squared">5.5 Squared or Horizontal</a></h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: Characters that are symbols composed of groups of
typically kana or Latin letters, digits plus slash for use in a single display
cell in vertical display of text.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: Many existing character sets contain these as
precomposed characters since for simple implementations this is the only way to
support the common use of providing metric units and other abbreviations in a
single character cell for vertical text layout.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Proposed markup, including CSS
styling, would be able express an unbounded set of these abbreviations,
obviating the need of cataloguing these in the character encoding standard and
making them more directly accessible to text based processing, for example
searching.</p>
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The repertoire of these legacy characters
is limited; many more combinations are in actual use than are accounted for in
character sets. Pre-composed symbols do not make their text content available to
search engines. They also require re-encoding for text laid out horizontally.</p>
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: The style property text-combine in the <cite>CSS3
module: text</cite> Working Draft [<a href="tr20-7.html#CSS3Text">CSS3Text</a>].</p>
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action required. (Subject to change
pending the outcome of current proposals.)</p>
<h3><a name="Superscripts">5.6 Superscripts and Subscripts</a></h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: Mainly super and subscript digits, but also
signs, parentheses and some letters.</p>
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: Super and subscript characters occur in many
legacy character sets, including Latin-1. Their use in pure plain text is common
for databases, e.g. including metric units for part descriptions&nbsp; (viz. cm<sup>2</sup>)
or (usually simplified) formulae as occur in titles of scientific publications.
Super and subscripted letters and digits are quite common in some forms of
phonetic or phonemic transcriptions. In particular, superscripted small digits
are often used to indicate tone.</p>
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Using these characters directly in
markup provides an alternate representation compared to marked up text, leading
to different treatment by search engines. However, when super and sub-scripts
are to reflect semantic distinctions, it is easier to work with these meanings
encoded in text rather than markup, for example, in phonetic or phonemic
transcription. When exporting to plain text, they may be inadvertently changed
to normal style text. For super or subscripted letters in phonetic transcription
in particular that would alter the meaning. On the other hand, some user agent
may support certain super or subscripted characters only when used as marked up
text.</p>
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: none</p>
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>:&lt;xhtml:sup&gt; and &lt;xhtml:sub&gt; or &lt;mathml:msup&gt;
and &lt;mathml:msub&gt;</p>
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action required.</p>
<h3><a name="Other">5.7 Other Characters Marked &lt;compat&gt;</a></h3>
<p><em>Short description</em>: The &lt;compat&gt; label was given to a set of
compatibility characters whose further classification was not settled at the
time the standard was created. The largest components are list item marker
characters.</p>
<p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters occur in many legacy
character sets.</p>
<p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: none. There usually is no equivalent
markup.</p>
<p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: none</p>
<p><em>Replacement markup</em>: none.</p>
<p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action required.</p>
<h2><a name="Noncharacters">6&nbsp; Noncharacters</a></h2>
<p>The Unicode Standard defines 66 non-character code points, or <i>noncharacters</i>.
These are the last two positions on each of the 17 planes, in other words, all
characters whose code points end in ...FFFE or ...FFFF, as well as the 32 code
points from U+FDD0 to U+FDEF. Applications are free to use any of these code
points internally but should never attempt to interchange them. In effect,
noncharacters can be thought of as application-internal private-use code points.</p>
<h2><a name="Versioning">7. Versioning</a></h2>
<p>This report will be updated by the Unicode Technical Committee in cooperation
with the W3C Internationalization WG whenever the tables of characters in this
document need to be updated as a result of the addition of characters to the
Unicode Standard, as a result of a revised determination of the suitability of a
given character for use with markup, or when additional background information
or recommendations become available.</p>
<p>Each report carries a revision number, which may be used to refer to a
specific version of the report. Older versions of the report will remain
available. Each version of this report specifies the underlying version of the
Unicode Standard.</p>
