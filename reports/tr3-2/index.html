<h2>Exploratory Proposals</h2>

<p>Text only version without charts</p>

<p>Until the end of the review period in August 1993: Permission is<br>
granted to freely reproduce this report in small quantities for<br>
purposes of review provided this notice remains affixed.</p>

<p>Review period closes August 15, 1993</p>

<p>Another draft will subsequently be issued for review</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This Technical Report is comprised of several exploratory proposals<br>
that the Unicode Technical Committee wishes to present for their<br>
first public review and commentary. These proposals have been<br>
generated from the committee's current knowledge about the scripts<br>
in question. Most of them are believed to be reasonable technical<br>
solutions for encoding of particular scripts, as far as can be<br>
ascertained at this time. However, many of them are known to be<br>
incomplete or be possessed of significant unresolved issues. The<br>
major unresolved issues are discussed in each proposal.</p>

<p>Technical inaccuracies and ambiguities are to be expected in a work<br>
of this nature, and most probably abound in these proposals. The<br>
work involves conjecture, relies on scanty information, and often<br>
requires re-interpretation as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>The committee is not strongly committed to these proposals as they<br>
stand, and further information is being actively sought. Suggestions<br>
for improvement by way of additional symbols, further technical<br>
requirements, changes in the script model, refinements to the block<br>
introductions, or any other information can be mailed to the Scripts<br>
Subcommittee at the Unicode, Inc. address. The committee especially<br>
wishes to invite active participation and feedback from the<br>
communities which these proposals are designed to serve.</p>

<p>In these exploratory proposals, it is often mentioned that ``sufficient<br>
information is not available'' for some particular aspect of the<br>
script under discussion. This does not refer to the availability<br>
of information in an absolute sense, rather that the committee has<br>
not yet been able to obtain sufficient information for its archives.</p>

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

<p>Many individuals, too numerous to list here, have contributed<br>
information over a period of over a year during which portions of<br>
this report have been in preparation. The Unicode Technical<br>
Committee wishes to thank them collectively for their contributions,<br>
and hopes to see more such involvement in the future.</p>

<p>The Glagolitic proposal was written by Joe Becker.<br>
All other proposals herein were written by Rick McGowan.</p>

<p>The following individuals have made significant contributions of<br>
time and energy in following bibliographic leads, searching libraries,<br>
forwarding information for the archives, or in analysis of various<br>
scripts included here:</p>

<p>Scott DeLancey, Lloyd Anderson, Andy Daniels, Elizabeth McGowan, <br>
Joan Aliprand, Glenn Adams, Lars-Erik Fredriksson, Asmus Freytag</p>

<h3>About the Epigraphic Blocks</h3>

<h4>Semitic Alphabets</h4>

<p>In these exploratory proposals, we distinguish two major ``Early Semitic <br>
Alphabet'' blocks, Phoenician and Early Aramaic, which are<br>
divided based on what may be termed ``significant'' differences in<br>
the shapes of various letters. Admittedly, this is a highly<br>
subjective choice. This arrangement makes two decisive cuts in<br>
a historical continuum covering several thousand years of middle-eastern<br>
history. The first cut is at approximately the point where several<br>
scripts leading eventually to the Aramaic and Hebrew branches began<br>
to be quite differentiated in their appearances from the branch<br>
that led to Punic. The second cut is at the point where the <br>
Aramaic/Hebrew branch began to noticeably split apart into the<br>
various lines that led to the Greek, Etruscan, and Latin branches<br>
on the one hand, and the Syriac, Arabic, and Hebrew branches on<br>
the other.</p>

<p>The alphabet encoded in the Early Phoenician block represents<br>
Phoenician as it stabilized by about 1100-1050 BC, as well as<br>
several early scripts that are quite closely related, though they<br>
are used to write a number of languages. The Phoenician block may<br>
be used, with appropriate font changes, to express Early Phoenician,<br>
Moabite, Early Hebrew, the earliest Early Aramaic, and Canaanite<br>
or Proto-Sinaitic scripts. It is also recommended for use to<br>
express Later Phoenician and Punic, which represent the main line<br>
of Phoenician evolution as a distinct script.</p>

<h4>Later Branches of the Phoenician Alphabet</h4>

<p>For encoding of Late Aramaic (especially papyri), Palmyrene, and<br>
Nabataean the Early Aramaic block should be used. The dividing<br>
line is relatively fuzzy, but in general a decision of which block<br>
to use can be made on the language, or when necessary on the general<br>
appearance of the script. The Unicode blocks are based rather<br>
roughly on ``significant'' differences in at least 12 letters (out<br>
of 22), including most obviously the letters transcribed as A(aleph), <br>
B, H-underdot, T-underdot, Y, S, and R. (A reasonable comparative<br>
source chart is contained in Healey's The Early Alphabet, fig. 15;<br>
the two blocks are divided approximately between the fourth and<br>
fifth of eight columns.)<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Related Historical Script Blocks</h4>

<p>South Arabian and its descendents used for the Lihyanite, Safaitic, <br>
and Thamudic languages are encoded in the South Arabian <br>
block. The Syriac scripts (Serta, Estrangela, and<br>
Nestorian and their immediate precursors such as Mandaic)<br>
are encoded in a Syriac block and treated as font differences<br>
from a prototypical Syriac script. (Mandaic shapes are<br>
also shown in the Syriac block.) Varieties of Syriac are<br>
in modern use. Etruscan and Oscan are encoded in the</p>

<h4>Etruscan block.</h4>

<p>Scripts Not Considered for Encoding<br>
Lydian, Lycian , Sidetic, Carian are not currently being<br>
considered for encoding. Information on the repertoire<br>
for the first two is available, but other significant<br>
information is lacking for all of them. They may eventually<br>
be encoded separately, or mapped onto other scripts.</p>

<p><strong>Future Directions</strong></p>

<p>In the future, this epigraphic introduction may be expanded to<br>
include further discussions of epigraphic scripts and families of<br>
scripts.</p>

<h3>Early Aramaic</h3>

<p>The Aramaic alphabet branched from the 22 letter alphabet used<br>
for Phoenician and evolved along separate lines culminating <br>
in Syriac, Arabic and other scripts. The Early Aramaic block should <br>
be used for Late Aramaic (especially papyri), Palmyrene, <br>
and Nabataean, Mandaic and their immediate precursors and successors.</p>

<p>The order shown in the accompanying chart matches the order of <br>
the Early Phoenician block and the shapes shown there are in the<br>
Palmyrene style.</p>

<h3>Balti</h3>

<p>The Balti script is now extinct, but was formerly used to write<br>
the Balti language of Baltistan, in what is now part of Ladakh in<br>
Northern Kashmir. The script was apparently introduced in about<br>
the fifteenth century when the people converted to Islam. It is<br>
related to the Arabic script.</p>

<p>In contrast to many other Indic scripts, Balti is written from<br>
right to left horizontally, in the Arabic manner. All of the vowel<br>
signs except long a are integrated into the glyphs used for<br>
consonants, becoming projections from the consonants rather than<br>
being separate marks as in most of the modern Indic scripts. The<br>
consonants apparently have an inherent a vowel (or an explicit<br>
vowel sign a may appear; there may not be a distinction between<br>
long and short a). There appears to be a sign (overdot) used to<br>
indicate the end of a word, but no interword spacing seems to be<br>
used.</p>

<p>The base form of b is the same as p and t; only the dots distinguish<br>
these. There are two other similar pairs. These appear to<br>
approximately parallel similar dotted versus dotless letters in Arabic.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> The set of Balti consonants is too small to make it worth<br>
encoding parallel to any of the other Indic scripts, or to Arabic.</p>

<p>Not enough information is available at this time to determine the<br>
completeness of the accompanying chart. The digits are unknown.</p>

<p>It is unknown how much literature is available in the old Balti<br>
script, or what the level of scholarly interest in it is. The<br>
function of the character listed in the names list as ``Balti null<br>
vowel or word ending'' is uncertain.</p>

<h3>Batak</h3>

<p>The Batak script is (or was) used to write Toba (or Toba-Batak), <br>
Mandailing, Dairi, and possibly other languages on the island <br>
of Sumatra . The alphabet is called si-sija-sija in Toba-Batak (van<br>
der Tuuk). Batak is read from left to right, but is often written<br>
similarly to Tagalog and Buhid, by writing vertically along the<br>
length of a piece of bamboo.</p>

<p>The phonetic system of the script is similar to the scripts of the<br>
Philippines (Tagalog). Like Tagalog and other scripts of the<br>
archipelagos between Southeast Asia and Australia, Batak ultimately<br>
derives from scripts of India. Batak has a virama and final<br>
consonants are expressed in the script. Like Tagalog, only two<br>
independent vowels other than a are included in the script (but<br>
several vowel signs are used). The alphabetical order (if van der</p>

<p>Tuuk gives it in order) differs from both the primeval Sanskritic<br>
and Tagalog orders; the accompanying chart is in the order given<br>
for Toba-Batak.</p>

<p>The vowel signs i, o, and the pangolat (=virama) are spacing marks.</p>

<p>The vowel signs e and final ng are non-spacing marks. The vowel<br>
sign i is placed after the consonant. The vowel sign u is placed<br>
under a consonant and somewhat to the right. Several ligated forms<br>
of letters with the u sound are known. The vowel sign o is placed<br>
after the consonant. The pangolet is likewise placed after the<br>
consonant, causing the inherent a vowel to be lost. The final ng<br>
is placed above the consonant and somewhat to the right. (When e<br>
and ng occur together on a consonant, thus, there are two dashlike<br>
marks above.) The hamisaran is usually written above the vowels<br>
i and o. When pangolat (the devoweller) is used to close a syllable,<br>
the vowel sign for the previous vowel is placed either under the<br>
final consonant or after the final consonant, and before the pangolat<br>
itself.</p>

<p>Punctuation is not normally used, all letters simply running<br>
together, but a bindu does exist and is occasionally used to<br>
disambiguate similar words or phrases. (This bindu is unfortunately<br>
known by the same name as the virama, pangolat.) The bindu apparently<br>
appears in several forms. One is called bindu pinardjolma and is<br>
used to separate sections of text; another is bindu pinarulok, and<br>
a third is bindu pinarboras, again used to separate sections of<br>
text. These marks are apparently large signs that physically<br>
separate sections of text, and may be more in the manner of ornaments<br>
than characters. Thus, only one bindu mark is included in the<br>
chart. A sign called pustaha is also sometimes used to separate<br>
a title from the main text which normally begins on the same line.</p>

<p><strong>Mandailing: </strong>The Mandailing alphabetical order differs somewhat<br>
from Toba-Batak, and North Mandailing again differs slightly from</p>

<p><strong>South Mandailing. </strong>Some of the letter shapes are likewise slightly<br>
different; these are ha and sa. The rendering forms for the<br>
consonant vowel-sign combinations pa+u, sa+u, and la+u may differ<br>
from the forms used for Toba Batak. Mandailing uses two other<br>
letters for k and tj sounds. These two letters are produced by<br>
putting a mark called tompi onto the normal letters for h and s.</p>

<p>It is not known whether the tompi is otherwise productive, so both<br>
the Mandailing letters and the tompi itself are included in the<br>
chart.</p>

<p><strong>Dairi: </strong>Dairi alphabetical order again differs from Toba-Batak and<br>
Mandailing. Dairi does not include the letter nja. The forms for<br>
ta and wa differ significantly from those used for Toba-Batak.</p>

<p>The vowel sign listed in the chart as u is pronounced more like a<br>
closed e and written after the associated consonant rather than<br>
under (or attached to) the consonant. The sign sikordjan, which<br>
is pronounced as a soft h following the associated vowel, is placed<br>
over the consonant. When final ng is used in Dairi, it goes over<br>
the previous consonant rather than over the vowel sign. In<br>
Toba-Batak, it may optionally go over the vowel if the vowel is<br>
not a non-spacing mark.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> It is not clear whether the Mandailing tompi is different<br>
from the Dairi sikordjan; if not, then one of them should be deleted<br>
from the chart.</p>

<p>Batak is known to have been in use in the mid-1800s. Nakanishi<br>
(1975) states that it is ``seldom used today.'' It may be extinct<br>
as of this writing (1992). The completeness of this analysis and<br>
chart is not known.</p>

<h3>Buginese</h3>

<p>The Buginese script is used on the island of Sulawesi, mainly in<br>
the south-west. It is of the Indic type and perhaps related to<br>
Javanese. It bears some affinity with Tagalog as well, and it<br>
apparently does not record final consonants. Buginese may be the<br>
easternmost representative of the Brahmi descendents. Sirk (1983)<br>
reports that the Buginese language (an Austronesian language) has<br>
a rich traditional literature making it one of the foremost languages<br>
of Indonesia. There may be as many as 2.3 million speakers of</p>

<p>Buginese in the southern part of Sulawesi (as of 1971). The script<br>
was reported in some use as of 1983, and a variety of traditional<br>
literature has been printed in it.</p>

<p>Buginese literature was studied extensively by B. F. Matthes (a<br>
Dutch missionary) in the 19th century. Matthes published a</p>

<p>Buginese-Dutch dictionary in 1874 with a supplement in 1889, as<br>
well as a grammar.. The script was previously also used to write<br>
the Makassarese, Bimanese, and Madurese languages.</p>

<p>Buginese seems to use spaces between certain units, which are noted<br>
by Sirk to be ``longer than a word in its grammatical definition.''</p>

<p>There is one punctuation symbol, pallawa, used ``to separate<br>
rhythmico-intonational groups, thus functionally corresponding to<br>
the full stop and comma of the Latin script.'' It is also apparently<br>
used sometimes to denote word doubling.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> The only page from Fossey available to this author (page<br>
377) comments that the ordering, also observed here, is after</p>

<p>Matthes, and further remarks on ``une certaine diffrence entre les<br>
caractres de ses publications et ceux de l'Imprimerie Nationale.''</p>

<p>The digits, if any, are unknown.</p>

<h3>Cherokee Syllabary</h3>

<p>The Cherokee script is a syllabic system used by <br>
the Cherokee Indians of North America. It was invented in the early 19th Century<br>
by Sequoyah who, realizing the power of written language, set out<br>
to produce a system of writing for his language. It was first<br>
tested among the Western Cherokee, and quickly adopted by the tribal<br>
council. The modern syllabary consists of 85 letters. There<br>
actually exist two forms of each letter; the modern symbols (shown<br>
here) are apparently the result of the need for simplified forms<br>
to be used with 19th century typesetting technology. As originally<br>
invented, the symbols were all much more cursive in form (see the<br>
sample in Alexander's Dictionary).</p>

<p>Modern Cherokee punctuation and page formatting conventions are as<br>
in English. Though the Cherokee syllabary is caseless, capitalization<br>
has been observed in some publications for proper names and at the<br>
beginning of each sentence, however, the ``majuscule'' letters do<br>
not differ at all in appearance from the minuscule letters, they<br>
are merely of larger size. Though Sequoyah invented a system of<br>
numerals for Cherokee, they were not adopted by the tribal council<br>
and have never been used. There are thus no independent digits<br>
encoded in the Cherokee block; Arabic (Western) digits are used.</p>

<p><strong>Encoding Structure:</strong> The Unicode block for the Cherokee script is<br>
arranged in linear order consistent with what seems to be its normal<br>
collation order. The columnar arrangement below is the typical<br>
arrangement shown in dictionaries and textbooks. The vowel written<br>
as &quot;v&quot; is a nasalized &quot;u&quot; (after Holmes &amp; Smith). No syllable mv
exists.</p>

<h4>Syllabary Layout</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>A E I O U V<br>
  GA KA GE GI GO GU GV</p>
  <p>HA HE HI HO HU HV<br>
  LA LE LI LO LU LV</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Other Issues: </strong>It may be advisable to include an 86th symbol, which<br>
was invented but quickly fell out of use. It occurs in facsimiles<br>
of pages in Sequoyah's hand. Its phonetic value has been reported<br>
as being close to that of HV.</p>

<h3>Etruscan</h3>

<p>The Etruscan script is used to write both the Etruscan and Oscan<br>
(or Oscan-Umbrian) languages. Etruscan was the language of a people<br>
(who called themselves rasna) in Etruria, corresponding to modern</p>

<p>Tuscany in western Italy. The Etruscan civilization lived alongside<br>
the Romans and there was much contact between the two. Inscriptions<br>
in Etruscan date from about the 7th century BC through the first<br>
century AD. The Etruscan and Oscan languages are unrelated, Oscan<br>
being an Italic language similar to Latin and Etruscan being<br>
imperfectly known and of uncertain linguistic affiliation.</p>

<p>Etruscan is written horizontally from right to left (occasionally<br>
boustrophedon). Archaic inscriptions have no spaces between words,<br>
but later inscriptions frequently have single or double dots between<br>
words. The letters ii and uu are used in Oscan but not in Etruscan.</p>

<p>The letters s and o (0E and 0F) appear in Etruscan inscriptions<br>
only in the context of abecedaries and were apparently not used in<br>
writing the Etruscan language.</p>

<p>Etruscan numerals are imperfectly known. They are similar to Roman<br>
numerals, but they are read and written from right to left, in<br>
contrast to Latin. The numerals at 26 and 27 are uncertain.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> The numerals are too uncertain at this time to warrant a<br>
final encoding; more information is necessary.</p>

<h3>Glagolitic</h3>

<p>Glagolitic, sometimes called by its Russian name Glagolitsa (``verbal<br>
script''), was developed in the 9th century to write Old Slavic.</p>

<p>It arose more or less in parallel with the Cyrillic alphabet for<br>
the same language, and the two alphabets correspond to each other<br>
quite closely. The relationship between the origins of Glagolitic<br>
and Cyrillic is unknown, though St. Cyril is said to have had a<br>
hand in both. The Cyrillic script gradually supplanted Glagolitic,<br>
but Glagolitic continued in some liturgical use until the 19th<br>
century.</p>

<p>In the encoding, Glagolitic is treated as a separate script from<br>
Cyrillic, principally because the letter shapes are in most cases<br>
totally unrelated, with differences not at all arising from &quot;mere<br>
font style&quot;. Glagolitic itself is seen in two slightly different<br>
styles, called the Bulgarian-Macedonian and Croatian. The Croatian<br>
form distinguishes uppercase and lowercase letters, although the<br>
difference in nearly all instances is merely one of size. The<br>
letterforms shown in the charts are Croatian style.</p>

<p>Like Cyrillic, the Glagolitic script is written in linear sequence<br>
from left to right with no contextual modification of the letterforms.</p>

<p><strong>Variant Glyph Forms: </strong>Two or three of the letters have variant<br>
glyph forms. These are not given separate character codes.</p>

<p><strong>Encoding Order: </strong>The ordering is basically the same as that of the<br>
(old) Cyrillic alphabet. Occasional sources show minor variations<br>
in the ordering of one or two characters.</p>

<p><strong>Letter Names: </strong>These old names for the Cyrillic letters apply as<br>
well to the Glagolitic.</p>

<p><strong>Encoding Structure:</strong> The Unicode block for the Glagolitic script<br>
is divided into the following ranges:<br>
U+00 to U+27 Uppercase letters (generic Glagolitic)<br>
U+28 to U+2F Currently unassigned U+30 to<br>
U+57 Lowercase letters (Croatian-style only) U+58 to<br>
U+5F Currently unassigned</p>

<p><strong>Open issues:</strong><br>
1. order and names of IZHE / I: seems to be random, may be<br>
able to find a preference.<br>
2. discrepancies with (DIS) 6861it appears to contain 3 pairs<br>
of variant glyphs for the same letters<br>
- suggest ignoring these, there's room to add them<br>
later if necessary it appears to contain 1 (or 2)<br>
pairs of letters seen nowhere else<br>
- suggest ignoring these, there's room to add them<br>
later if appropriate it appears to contain 1<br>
duplicated glyph (IZHE)<br>
- suggest ignoring this, apparently a mistake</p>

<h3>Kirat (Limbu)</h3>

<p>The Limbu (or Kirat or Kiranti) alphabet is (or was) used among<br>
the Limbu of Sikkim and Darjeeling. Kirat is structurally similar<br>
to the Róng (Lepcha) script. It has 20 consonants (including the<br>
stand-alone ``A'' as in other Indic scripts), 8 vowel signs, 7<br>
(or 8 or 10?) final consonants. Letters YA, RA, and WA may be<br>
subscripted in a manner similar to the Tibetan and Róng scripts.</p>

<p>There appears to have been, at sometime in the past, an orthographic<br>
reform, and two slightly different varieties of the script appear<br>
to be in existence.</p>

<p>There are three other symbols needed for proper pronunciation of<br>
Limbu. These are mukphreng (aspiration mark), kehmphreng (length<br>
mark) and sa-i (possibly the virama). The sa-i appears to be used<br>
to remove the inherent A sound like a virama. Sa-i has been<br>
conjectured to occur visibly only in word-medial position. It has<br>
been observed also in apparent word-final position. Its function<br>
may be therefor different from an invisible virama.</p>

<p>Kirat appears to include three other marks, the names of which are<br>
not presently known. These are (1) a mark indicating colon or full<br>
stop, (2) a mark indicating a prolonged final note during a chant,<br>
(3) a mark which looks like the Oriya anusvara (a circle above)<br>
indicating an acute type of accent.</p>

<p>The accompanying chart was prepared from a draft supplied <br>
by Lloyd Anderson. The ISCII model and layout is followed in the accompanying<br>
chart. The shaded cells to the far right are final consonants<br>
(lower nine cells), a ``tr'' conjunct and a ``j'' rendering form.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> It is not known whether the Kirat script is still in use<br>
as of this writing (1992). It was reported in 1855 as nearly<br>
extinct, but sources as recent as 1979 are available.</p>

<p>This draft for Kirat is by no means complete. Sources vary even<br>
as to the correct number of final consonants (or ``conjoint letters''<br>
called kedumba sok); there may be as many as ten of them.</p>

<p>There are two different approaches to encoding of Kirat. If the<br>
script is postulated to contain an invisible virama distinct from<br>
sa-i, then the final consonants could be rendered in text by using<br>
this virama followed by the corresponding normal forms If, however,<br>
no such invisible virama is postulated, then the final consonants<br>
should be encoded distinctly. There is no concrete evidence yet<br>
available [to this author] for or against such an invisible virama<br>
that is distinct from sa-i. Both are transliterated into Devanagari<br>
by use of half-consonant forms, as Devanagari has no such distinction<br>
at all. The final consonants cannot be rendered alone by use of<br>
sa-i, since the sa-i appears to be always visible when it occurs,<br>
and kedumba sok forms also occur without the sa-i. There thus<br>
appears to be some distinction, and sa-i alone is insufficient to<br>
generate both forms. Sa-i is also seen with full consonants, where<br>
it presumably functions like a virama (in eliding the inherent<br>
vowel). Because of these observations the final consonants should, perhaps<br>
be encode distinctly and no invisible<em>virama</em> encoded. In this <br>
case Limbu would then be similar to the model for Rong. See <br>
the block introduction for Rong, Lepcha.</p>

<p>In either case, the script bears some similarity to the Róng script,<br>
and it seems that the same conceptual model should be used for<br>
both. Kirat could be laid out in a manner compatible with ISCII<br>
and parallel to Devanagari as far as the arrangement of its vowels<br>
and consonants. However, since it has a somewhat smaller complement<br>
of consonants than Devanagari, and needs no precomposed long vowels,<br>
many empty codepoints are unnecessarily scattered throughout such<br>
an encoding. Kirat could also be encoded parallel to Tibetan as<br>
far as the arrangement of its consonants.</p>

<h3>Linear B</h3>

<p>The script called Linear B is a syllabic system that was used on<br>
the island of Crete (and parts of the nearby mainland) to write<br>
the oldest recorded variety of the Greek language. Linear B clay<br>
tablets predate Homeric Greek by some 700 years, the latest being<br>
from about 1375 BC. Major archaeological sites include Knossos,<br>
first uncovered in about 1900 by Sir Arthur Evans, and a major site<br>
near Pylos on the mainland. The majority of inscriptions currently<br>
known are inventories of commodities and accounting records.</p>

<p>The script resisted early attempts at decipherment, but it finally<br>
yielded to the efforts of Michael Ventris, an architect and amateur<br>
decipherer. Ventris' breakthrough in decipherment came after the<br>
realization that the language might be Greek, and not (as had been<br>
previously thought) a completely unknown language. Ventris formed<br>
an alliance with John Chadwick, and decipherment proceeded quickly.<br>
Ventris and Chadwick published a joint paper in 1953.</p>

<p>Linear B was written from left to right with no non-spacing marks<br>
or other complications. The script consists mainly of a number of<br>
phonetic signs representing the combination of a consonant and<br>
vowel. There are 60 known phonetic signs, a few signs that seem<br>
to be mainly free variants (Chadwick's optional signs), a few<br>
unidentified signs, numerals, and a number of ideographic signs<br>
which were used mainly as counters for commodities. Some ligatures<br>
formed from combinations of syllables were apparently used as well.</p>

<p>Chadwick gives several examples of these ligatures, which are not<br>
included in this encoding.</p>

<p>The signs having phonetic values beginning with J are pronounced<br>
in the German manner as the English Y.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> The first four rows (through the syllable zo) are well<br>
established; the rest of the symbols are more questionable. Some<br>
of the unknown symbols may now be known, and hence require some<br>
movement of codes. The characters for weights are not necessarily<br>
in a sensible order. There may be no distinction between characters<br>
43 and 6A. The ideograms (e.g., for weight) may be the tip of a<br>
much larger ideographic iceberg, though the sources would seem to<br>
indicate that there are only a small number of such ideograms.</p>

<p>The 5th unknown symbol may be gold, but it's not clear; one older<br>
source listed it as unknown, but Chadwick's book (see below) lists<br>
it as meaning gold. The character names for the weight units<br>
reflect the lists in Chadwick, but do not convey the proper meaning<br>
well; better names must be found.</p>

<p>The historical importance of Linear B is well established. It may<br>
make sense, however, to encode Linear B along with Linear A and<br>
the Cypriot Syllabary of Enkomi, either as a unified set of signs<br>
or separately in adjacent blocks with phonetic parallels. Unicode<br>
archives contain some references for Linear A and Cypriot.</p>

<p>The Linear B ligatures may be another case requiring the encoding<br>
of some form of ligature manufacturing code in Unicode, since such<br>
ligatures would be optional and totally free variants in any<br>
rendering system. Such a ligature code has been widely discussed,<br>
and may be necessary in other scripts as well.</p>

<h3>Maldivian (Dihevi)</h3>

<p>The Maldivian script is used in the Republic of Maldives (a group<br>
of atolls in the Indian Ocean, circa 400 miles SW of Sri Lanka,<br>
about 4N 73E) to write the Dihevi language.</p>

<p>Maldivian is written from right to left and partakes of features<br>
of both the Indic and Arabic script varieties. Consonants have an<br>
inherent a vowel sound, but they are always written with either a<br>
vowel sign or a null ``vanishing vowel'' sign (U+xx2A) above them.</p>

<p>On alif (U+xx07) the null vowel sign is a glottal stop. Loanwords<br>
from Arabic are also written in the Arabic script or transcribed<br>
by means of dots on existing Maldivian letters. Both Arabic and<br>
Western digits are used.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> There is also an older set of Maldivian letter forms (for<br>
which see Faulmann) which are completely different from, yet exactly<br>
parallels these. It should probably not be considered a separate<br>
script. The older form could be used by shifting fonts.</p>

<p><strong>Encoding Structure:</strong> The Unicode block for the Maldivian script is<br>
divided into four ranges: U+xx00 U+xx17 Consonant Letters U+xx18<br>
U+xx23 Extended Maldivian Letters U+xx24 Currently unassigned<br>
U+xx25 U+xx2F Non-spacing Vowel Signs</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> The enumeration of the 12 Extended Maldivian Letters used<br>
for transcriptions of Arabic letters is consistent with the Unicode<br>
treatment of the Arabic script, in which various combinations of<br>
dots are always alotted separate code points. The source of these<br>
is the Library of Congress Cataloging Service Bulletin, No. 19 /<br>
Winter 1982. The 12 text elements listed in that publication<br>
follow, in Arabic alphabetic order, with their Arabic equivalents:</p>

<h4>Maldivian Character Arabic Letter Equivalent</h4>

<p>TH + triple overdot THAA</p>

<p>H + underdot HAA</p>

<p>H + overdot KHAA<br>
D + overdot THAL</p>

<p>S + triple overdot SHEEN</p>

<p>S + underdot SAD</p>

<p>S + overdot DAD</p>

<p>TH + underdot TAH</p>

<p>TH + overdot DHAH</p>

<p>A + underdot AIN</p>

<p>A + overdot GHAIN<br>
G + double overdot QAF</p>

<p>The idea that Maldivian letters have an inherent a vowel is from<br>
Nakanishi, but it seems inconsistent with the fact that the letters<br>
never appear without a vowel sign or a null-vowel sign. This issue<br>
must be clarified.</p>

<h3>Manipuri (Meithei)</h3>

<p>The Manipuri script is a recently extinct script that was formerly<br>
used to write the Methei language in Manipur State, India. The<br>
script may have been introduced as early as the fourteenth century<br>
or as late as the sixteenth. The only available source has been<br>
Grierson (see below).</p>

<p>The script is of the same lineage as Devanagari. Unlike Devanagari,<br>
there are no independent signs for vowels other than a, the other<br>
independent vowels being expressed as signs upon the independent<br>
vowel a (similar to the Tibetan method). The consonantal and vowel<br>
systems are both fairly complete, so it is probably most useful<br>
and correct to encode it in the ISCII manner, parallel to Devanagari<br>
as much as possible.</p>

<p>The anusvara (nasalization) mark in Manipuri produces some special<br>
rendering forms depending on the vowel preceding it. There are<br>
eight of these, producing the endings ang, -áng, -íng, -ing, -eng,<br>
-ung, -úng, and -ong. The rendering forms look like ligatures of<br>
the vowel sign with the anusvara, or similar. Manipuri contains no<br>
long O vowel, so the place of the long O is filled with the dipthong<br>
sign AO, which does not seem to fit elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> Because Manipuri lacks special symbols for the independent<br>
vowels, the entire first column of an encoding completely parallel<br>
to Devanagari would be empty but for anusvara and the letter A .</p>

<p>Therefore, to save one column, these have been moved into the column<br>
containing the consonants, so that A occurs just before KA, and<br>
the anusvara is left in the third position of that same row. The<br>
script can thus be put into four rows instead of five. There are<br>
presumably digits belonging to Manipuri, but no samples have been<br>
available. Space for them is available in the fifth column of the<br>
chart. It is also not known how much scholarly and historical<br>
interest there is in the Manipuri script.</p>

<h3>Meroïtic</h3>

<p>Meroïtic was the language of a great African kingdom (called Kush)<br>
which lay to the south of Egypt in what is now the Sudan. The<br>
capital city was Mero (modern Begrawiya), along the Nile River.</p>

<p>The Meroïtic script is a syllabary, and its glyphs are derived from<br>
or related to Egyptian Hieroglyphics. It comes in two forms,<br>
monumental (Hieroglyphic) and cursive, of which the monumental is<br>
much more rare. The two forms bear very little outward resemblance,<br>
the one looking very much like Egyptian, the other quite abbreviated,<br>
not unlike Demotic.</p>

<p>The earliest dated Meroïtic inscriptions are from about 180 BC, and<br>
it was extinct by the 5th Century AD. The Meroïtic script was first<br>
deciphered by F. L. Griffith in the early 1900s and that work was<br>
later refined somewhat by F. Hintze and others. The language<br>
itself, though, remains incompletely known in the absence of<br>
bilingual inscriptions and relationships to other known languages.</p>

<p>Most consonantal signs of Meroïtic have an inherent a vowel, except<br>
when they are followed by one of the vowel signs i, e, or o. There<br>
are special signs for the combinations ne, se, te, and to. Meroïtic<br>
is usually written from right to left in cursive form, and from<br>
top to bottom (with columns running from right to left) in monumental<br>
form. In the monumental form, the human and animal figures face<br>
in the direction which the text runs (i.e., away from the beginning<br>
of the line). It should be carefully noted that this is unlike</p>

<p>Egyptian, in which the figures face the beginning of the line.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> The main draft chart shows the cursive form, with<br>
corresponding hieroglyphic shapes in columns labelled X and Y.</p>

<p>These have completely different values than identical Egyptian</p>

<p>Hieroglyphic symbols, and unification of Meroïtic and Egyptian (if<br>
attempted) would be purely on the basis of glyphic identity in the<br>
monumental form, not on abstract letter semantics. Unification<br>
seems inadvisable because the normal form is the cursive form.</p>

<p>The ordering of symbols in the two main sources differs in the 3rd<br>
and 4th positions (o and i) and also in the 16th and 17th positions<br>
(s and se). The order used here is that given in Friedrich, while<br>
the transliteration is after Davies. There does not seem to be a<br>
standard order.</p>

<h3>Tifinagh, Numidian</h3>

<p>Tifinagh is a living script used among the Berber people of the</p>

<p>Sahara. It seems to be a direct descendant of the ancient Numidian<br>
script, with which it shares many of its letter forms. (Numidian<br>
is also called Libyan by Diringer who notes that it is contemporaneous<br>
with the Roman period.) Unfortunately, not much more is known<br>
about it at this time. It was apparently influenced by Punic.</p>

<p>Numidian was normally written from bottom to top, in columns from<br>
left to right. In some bilingual Numidian and Punic inscriptions,<br>
the Numidian parts were written from right to left horizontally in<br>
the Punic manner.</p>

<p>Modern Tifinagh is apparently written horizontally, from right to<br>
left with lines running from top to bottom. There are some ligatures<br>
used in writing Tifinagh. It is not known whether they are obligatory<br>
or not in Tifinagh rendering.</p>

<p>Neither Tifinagh nor Numidian uses any diacritical marks or other<br>
non-spacing characters. Some of the glyphs in both Numidian and</p>

<p>Tifinagh change form depending on whether they are being written<br>
horizontally or vertically.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> The script called Tamachek may be the same thing as</p>

<p><strong>Tifinagh.</strong> The names list is purely for identification and must<br>
be revised when information becomes available.</p>

<p>It is not at all clear whether Tifinagh should be encoded separately<br>
from Numidian or whether they should be encoded as a single composite<br>
script. Some of the graphic elements used for one phonetic value<br>
in Tifinagh were used for a completely different phonetic value in<br>
Numidian. Fairly solid information on Tifinagh, including ligatures<br>
and the alphabet, is currently available, as is information on<br>
Numidian. Since they have very high overlap in terms of signs, it<br>
seems reasonable to encode them either in parallel or as a single<br>
script, depending primarily upon graphic form for the choice of<br>
the character complement. Not enough information is available<br>
about the history of either to make this proposal very complete.</p>

<p>The accompanying charts were prepared from draft charts supplied<br>
by Lloyd Anderson. They are laid out to match each other phonetically,<br>
and are both parallel to the Unicode Hebrew block. They are here<br>
supplied together for information and comparison. The left hand<br>
group is Numidian, with glyphs for vertical writing. The middle<br>
group is Numidian, with glyphs for horizontal writing. The right<br>
hand group is modern Tifinagh.</p>

<h3>Ogham</h3>

<p>The Ogham script was used in Ireland and England prior to the<br>
introduction of the Latin alphabet. The form of its letters seems<br>
heavily influenced by the medium with which it was used; it was<br>
most often scratched on stones and posts, as well as on the frames<br>
of doors. At least one interactive variety called ``leg Ogham''<br>
(reported in the Book of Ballymote) was also apparently used; it<br>
was signed with the hands upon the shin, the five fingers being<br>
used in a manner suggesting the horizontal lines of the script.</p>

<p>The Ogham is divided into groups of five. The last five are<br>
diphthongs, and are later developments. Each letter has a traditional<br>
name which is the name of a tree or shrub. Some of the phonetic<br>
values apparently differ depending on the locale in which it was<br>
used and the language being written.</p>

<p>Ogham was formerly written on stones and door lintels from the<br>
bottom left hand side, over the crest, and down the right hand<br>
side. The center line in the charts represents the corner of a<br>
stone or lintel. It is suggested that it be rendered on computers<br>
from left to right, turned 90 degrees counterclockwise with the<br>
center line running horizontally, or top to bottom, with the center<br>
line running vertically.</p>

<p>Punctuation was not normally used in Ogham, but later developments<br>
suggest that a middle dot delimiter or a vertical line delimiter<br>
may be used; sources are unclear on this point.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> There is distinct disagreement in the sources available<br>
as to the order of the first five letters. Ogham has been called<br>
``Beth-Luis-Nuin'' possibly after the first three letters, but<br>
other sources say these are the first, second, and fifth letters.</p>

<p>In either case, the sources thus give conflicting names for the<br>
latter three of the first five letters. This question must be<br>
resolved satisfactorily before a final encoding can be made. The<br>
present names are after Lehmann (see below).</p>

<h3>Pahlavi/Avestan</h3>

<p>The Pahlavi script is an historically important script related to<br>
the Arabic script. It was used (in various related forms) over a<br>
period of nearly a thousand years to write Pazand, Middle Persian,<br>
Parthian, and Pahlavi languages. An improved form of Pahlavi which<br>
includes explicit vowel letters was used to write the Avesta (the<br>
sacred book of Zoroastrianism containing teachings of the prophet<br>
Zoroaster or Zarathushtra); the latter form of the script is referred<br>
to as Avestan.</p>

<p>Pahlavi is written from right to left, in the Arabic manner. The<br>
form known as Book Pahlavi contains only 13 simple letters, certain<br>
graphemes that originally represented distinct letters having been<br>
coalesced to a high degree. Avestan, on the other hand, is improved<br>
and the ambiguities are much less. The accompanying chart is<br>
intended for use with Pahlavi and Avestan both. The Avestan letter<br>
forms are shown, and some of the Book Pahlavi forms differ slightly<br>
from these.</p>

<p>Pahlavi utilizes a complex seemingly open-ended set of ligatures<br>
and pronounciation changes in various combinations. Many of the<br>
letters do some sort of ``double duty.'' There are complex cursive<br>
connections between certain characters preceding or following.</p>

<p>Some of the double-duty letters were sometimes written with<br>
diacritical marks or dots to remove ambiguities in some situations.</p>

<p>The Avestan alphabet, in contrast, is much more regular and the<br>
letters generally refer to a single phoneme. The set of vowel<br>
letters in Avestan is considerably improved, and there are fewer<br>
(or no) cursive connections. The letter called ao by Jackson is<br>
a ligature of aa + schwa.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> The order given here is not very good. The main source<br>
for Avestan (Jackson) is mute regarding alphabetical order. There<br>
was a bit of detective work involved in generating correspondences<br>
between that and other sources on Book Pahlavi. The shapes in the<br>
accompanying chart are the Avestan shapes (after Jackson). The<br>
letter aa may be better unencoded, simply using a + a. A case<br>
could probably be made for having an abstract length mark which<br>
could be used for doubling the vowels. It seems to be the case<br>
that, except for a, the short vertical appendage below each vowel<br>
has the meaning of lengthening it.</p>

<p>Complete names for the Avestan letters being currently unavailable,<br>
the names list is a hodge-podge using a semblance of the phonetic<br>
value, mainly after Jackson. The numerals are not well specified<br>
in the sources available at this time; hence, no numerals are given<br>
in the accompanying chart.</p>

<p>Pahlavi seems to contain a large number of words called ``ideograms''<br>
in the literature (see Nyberg, for instance) that appear to be<br>
words which are actually pronounced and have a meaning fairly<br>
unrelated to their ``literal'' meaning and pronounciation if viewed<br>
simply as a group of letters.</p>

<p>There are two important ligatures that stand for the endings et,<br>
eh, or end. None of the sources gave enough detail on the usage<br>
and etymology of these. It is also not clear whether some of the<br>
``letters'' of Avestan given by Jackson should not be simple<br>
ligatures; these are sk, s-ogonek-hacek, n-tilde, ao. These are<br>
not shown in the accompanying chart.</p>

<p>Jackson seems to not give an alphabetical order. The Book Pahlavi<br>
alphabetical order should probably be followed, and this does that<br>
to some extent. However, the interpolation of some letters may<br>
mean that there are letters out of order here, and the order should<br>
be carefully considered.</p>

<h3>Old Persian Cuneiform</h3>

<p>Old Persian cuneiform was used extensively over a large area drained<br>
by the Euphrates and Tigris rivers in lands that were once called</p>

<p>Akkad and Sumer. It was the first type of cuneiform to be deciphered<br>
in modern times. The script is traditionally said to have been<br>
invented by Darius I (ca 521-486 BC) so that he might be comparable<br>
to Babylonian and Assyrian kings; by about 300 BC it had fallen<br>
out of use.</p>

<p>Old Persian inscriptions were first seriously studied by C. Niebuhr<br>
in 1765, though various types of cuneiform inscriptions had been<br>
known in the West for quite some time. Preliminary studies which<br>
eventually culminated in decipherment and understanding of the<br>
language were made as early as 1798 by O.G. Tycheson <br>
and F.C.C.Münter; they were succeeded in the task by G.F. Grotefend and others.</p>

<p>Decipherment was essentially complete by about 1845. Decipherment<br>
was also achieved, quite independently, by H. C. Rawlinson between<br>
about 1836 and 1850. A rather small literature in Old Persian is<br>
extant, but it includes some lengthy carved inscriptions at Behistun<br>
and Persepolis (northeast of modern Baghdad along the Tigris River).</p>

<p>The system is essentially a syllabary of thirty-six signs, augmented<br>
by a specialized word divider and five ideographs. The ideographs<br>
are for king, country, earth, god, and the supreme diety of the<br>
time, Ahura-Mazda. Of these, the latter appears in several minor<br>
glyphic variations. The script is thought to be complete in this<br>
encoding; it should not be confused with the much earlier ideographic<br>
cuneiform scripts of Akkadian and Sumerian derivation.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> The numbers (1, 2, 3, 10, 20, 40, 100) may be incomplete<br>
in the chart, but sufficient information is not available at this<br>
time. These numbers could be compressed together, but in this<br>
chart are spread out into what may be appropriate places, assuming<br>
the existence of other number signs. They could also be packed at<br>
the end of the script. If a word-divider is shared with Ugaritic<br>
Cuneiform (and was encoded there), then the seven numbers could be<br>
put into the third column of the chart, and Old Persian would fit<br>
into three complete rows instead of taking part of a fourth row.</p>

<h3>Phoenician</h3>

<p>The Phoenician alphabet and its successors were widely used over<br>
a broad area surrounding the Medierranean Sea. Phoenician evolved<br>
over several hundred years from the end of the 2nd millenium BC<br>
(before 1100 BC) with some modifications until the 2nd century BC,<br>
with the last neo-Punic inscriptions dating from about the 3rd<br>
century AD. The Phoenician alphabet is a forerunner of the Etruscan,<br>
Latin, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac scripts among others, many<br>
of which are still in modern use. It has also been suggested that<br>
Phoenician is the ultimate source of the Indic scripts descending<br>
from Brahmi and Kharoshthi.</p>

<p>Phoenician is quintessentially illustrative of the historical<br>
problem of where to draw lines in an evolutionary tree of contiuously<br>
changing scripts extending over thousands of years. The twenty<br>
two letters in the Phoenician block may be used, with appropriate<br>
font changes, to express Early Phoenician, Moabite, Early Hebrew,<br>
Later Phoenician, and Punic, and possibly some Early Aramaic. It<br>
is especially intended for use with Phoenician and Punic. The<br>
historical cut that has been made in Unicode considers the line<br>
from Phoenician to Punic to represent a single continuous branch<br>
of script evolution.</p>

<p>Phoenician is generally written from right to left horizontally.</p>

<p>Phoenician language inscriptions usually have no space between<br>
words; there are sometimes dots between words in later inscriptions<br>
(e.g., in Moabite inscriptions). Typical fonts for the Phoenician<br>
and especially Punic have very exaggerated descenders. These<br>
descenders help distinguish the main line of Phoenician evolution<br>
toward Punic from the other (e.g., Hebrew) branches of the script,<br>
where the descenders instead grew shorter over time.</p>

<h3>Róng (Lepcha)</h3>

<p>The Róng script (also called Lepcha) is used to write the Róng language<br>
of Sikkim (located between Nepal and Bhutan, just south of Tibet).</p>

<p>It bears structural similarity to Tibetan, from whence it probably<br>
ultimately derives. The script is tradtionally held to have been<br>
invented by a Sikkim Raja (named Phyag-rdor-rnam-rgyal) in the<br>
early 18th century. This ``invention'' was probably actually an<br>
extensive revision of an older script. A unique feature of the<br>
script is its use of syllable-final ``floating consonant signs''<br>
(U+xx37 U+xx3F). These signs were probably invented for and<br>
introduced into the Róng script by the reviser. This structural<br>
feature eliminates the need for any conjunct consonants in Rong.</p>

<p>The signs for letters with an infixed ``L'' sound are likewise<br>
unknown from other scripts of the area, and seem to be a unique<br>
feature.</p>

<p>The two signs KYA and KRA (U+xx24 and U+xx25) are analogous to the</p>

<p>Tibetan ya-ta and ra-ta but are affixed after the preceding consonant<br>
rather than as subscripts. Róng typography uses a number of very<br>
regular ligatures formed by consonants with succeeding KYA and KRA.</p>

<p>There is also a special ligature form of KRA followed by KYA, which<br>
itself forms ligatures with the preceding consonant. Of the seven<br>
vowel signs, three (U+xx31 U+xx33) are reordered in display, as<br>
are two of the syllable-final floating consonant signs (U+xx3E and<br>
U+xx3F). When a vowel sign of the reordering type is followed by<br>
one of the floating consonant signs of the reordering type, the<br>
consonant sign is written to the left of the vowel sign.</p>

<p>Róng occasionally makes use of a floating dot (U+xx2E) below consonants<br>
to distinguish special pronunciations (an innovation introduced by<br>
Mainwaring). The floating mark RAN (U+xx2F) is used over consonants<br>
(and above their associated floating consonant signs, if any) to<br>
indicate a slight lengthening or emphasis of the vowel. The only<br>
punctuation is U+xx2D, equivalent to the Devanagari danda. Róng<br>
seems to always be written with space between words or compound<br>
words.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> Unless there has been a recent revival, this script is<br>
probably not in active use at all as of this writing (1992).</p>

<p>Haarh's 1959 article seems to imply that the script was still in<br>
use at that time. The Baptist mission in the late 1800s apparently<br>
printed three books of the New Testament in the script. While<br>
Mainwaring's work (1876) gives an encouraging picture, Gorer's<br>
ethnography of the Lepcha (written in 1938, revised in 1967) is<br>
quite clear as regards the script. Gorer contends that it was<br>
rather artificially revived by the eccentric General Mainwaring,<br>
and reports that he could find only one old lama who possessed or<br>
could read a book in the script:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...the Lepcha script, never widely known, has now completely fallen<br>
  into disuse; in order to read the scriptures Lepchas have to learn a<br>
  new, and otherwise completely useless, alphabet; most of them are<br>
  far more familiar with Nepali. ... All the existing Lepcha manuscripts<br>
  of which I have heard are translations of the Tibetan lamaist<br>
  scriptures... (Gorer, p. 38-39)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Róng is structurally similar to Kirat (Limbu), especially in its<br>
use of floating final consonant signs, which are also used in Kirat.</p>

<p>In this respect the two scripts differ from most (or all?) other<br>
scripts of the area. These signs would seem to be an innovation<br>
of the Róng script which was taken up in the Kirat script. The<br>
language for which the script was originally invented is a<br>
``mono-syllabic'' type language. The script is apparently derived<br>
from the Tibetan script, but Róng was revised in the early 1700s,<br>
at which time these signs were introduced. This model presumes<br>
the final consonant signs to be a unique invention that makes<br>
structural sense in the script and the language which it is intended<br>
to serve. In this author's view, this model is straightforward,<br>
and should be more or less retained unless strong evidence to the<br>
contrary becomes available.</p>

<p>It has been argued elsewhere, however, that the Róng (and Kirat)<br>
final consonants are simply rendering forms, and hence should be<br>
spelled by means of an affixed invisible virama (which would follow<br>
a normal consonant and produce visually one of the floating signs<br>
in word-final position). No evidence available at this time suggests<br>
that any type of virama (visible or invisible) is known in the<br>
script at all. The possibility cannot be completely discounted,<br>
however, since the script derives ultimately from Brahmi and the<br>
other Indic scripts, and there is some evidence for an invisible<br>
virama (at least conceptually) in Tibetan. Such a model would<br>
include a virama and use it to spell the final consonant signs; it<br>
would also presumably encode the consonants with infix-l offglide<br>
(such as HLA) with this virama as well. Such a model is not without<br>
some merit, chiefly in paralleling existing script encodings.</p>

<p>It has also been suggested that Róng (as well as Kirat) could be<br>
encoded (at least partially) parallel to the order of the Tibetan<br>
block, or it could be encoded parallel to ISCII. While neither of<br>
these is particularly compelling, the closer relation to the Tibetan<br>
script makes it the more likely choice, if it must be encoded<br>
parallel to another script.</p>

<p>The letters with infixed &quot;L&quot;' could also be moved elsewhere in<br>
the alphabetic order, which may make alphabetization easier or more<br>
clear. Mainwaring's dictionary order may be artificial.</p>

<p>This draft for Róng is by no means a final answer. The available<br>
sources are somewhat sketchy as regards fine points of the script;<br>
not enough analytical sources or textual sources are available at<br>
this time to conclusively resolve some of the issues. See also the<br>
block introduction for Kirat (Limbu).</p>

<h3>Northern Runes</h3>

<p>The Northern Runic script was widely used in northern Europe,<br>
primarily in Scandinavia and Germany, between about the second and<br>
eleventh centuries AD when it was gradually replaced by the Latin<br>
alphabet. (We call it the Northern Runic script to distinguish it<br>
from other so-called Runic scripts, such as the Turkic.) Northern<br>
Runes were also used in England from about the 7th century AD.</p>

<p>Some 5000 known Runic inscriptions survive from the central cultural<br>
area and outlying areas as far away as Russia, Poland, and North<br>
America. Inscriptions are found primarily on wood, stone, and<br>
metal objects, but there are also extant manuscripts that explain<br>
the runes. These inscriptions often consist simply of the letters<br>
of the (local) alphabet written out in standardized order, so the<br>
alphabetical orders are well known and various stages can be compared<br>
with relative ease.</p>

<p>The Runic alphabet for a given language and locale is commonly<br>
referred to as the futhark, a name derived from its first six<br>
letters. There are two major branches of Northern Runes, the<br>
Germanic branch and the Scandinavian branch, which differ in their<br>
arrangement and in the forms of many characters. The Runic script<br>
modelled in this block is a minimal composite of graphic forms<br>
derived from the major Runic alphabets. These alphabets and their<br>
glyphic variants are considered here to be built from elements of<br>
a single larger Runic script. The Runic script, however, is not<br>
a predefined entity, rather a theoretical construction consisting<br>
of the graphic elements which must be minimally distinguished and<br>
grouped into ``glyphic alternative'' bundles where appropriate.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian futhark consisted of 16 base characters, apparently<br>
derived by eliminating symbols from the older futhark, but with<br>
other changes as well. A dot or double-dot mark was used on five<br>
of these base characters bringing the total distinct symbols to<br>
21. In several instances the form used for one sound in the<br>
Scandinavian was used for a different sound in the Germanic (this<br>
fact is more apparent when various futharks using variant glyphs<br>
are brought together for comparison than it is in the charts shown<br>
here). The Scandinavian futhark includes the so-called ``short<br>
twig'' or Hlsing Runic shapes.</p>

<p>The Runes evolved considerably over the course of some 1000 years,<br>
often differently in various locales. It cannot be stressed enough<br>
that the Unicode Runic block is abstracted from the historical<br>
inscriptions used throughout the Runic cultural area. Some<br>
characters, our composite runes numbered 10 and 26 for instance,<br>
assumed a wide variety of related forms; the h rune (composite<br>
number 13) could have one or two bars. The glyphic forms used in<br>
the charts are not intended to be normative, merely illustrative<br>
of the more typical shapes.</p>

<p><strong>Display and rendering: </strong>The predominant writing direction was in<br>
horizontal lines from left to right. However, they were also<br>
sometimes written retrograde. The earliest inscriptions were<br>
written with no punctuation and run-together words, much like<br>
ancient Greek. Later inscriptions often made use of a colon (:)<br>
or middle-dot between words (not included in this block). Fonts<br>
for the Runes would probably encode a superset of the most widely<br>
used glyphs, from which glyphs would be chosen to represent one or<br>
the other of the desired futhark surface structures with their<br>
variations. (The stroke font designed for the accompanying chart<br>
is one example; the full glyphic complement of this font is shown.)</p>

<p>Some later inscriptions also mixed Latin letters with runes, so it<br>
seems not unreasonable that the most flexible fonts would include<br>
various harmonious Latin shapes as well. Ligatures were sometimes<br>
used in Runic inscriptions. They seem to have been freely formed<br>
by bodily fusion of two or more characters, Issues: Because <br>
the Anglo-Saxon and Germanic futharks are closely<br>
related in most of their forms and functions, the major part of<br>
the Anglo-Saxon one can be mapped directly onto the Germanic futhark<br>
of 24 letters. (There are seven extra characters used for Anglo-Saxon.) </p>

<p>The Runic block could then be divided into two parts,<br>
one representing the Anglo-Saxon and Germanic branches with a total<br>
of 31 characters (referred to as the older futhark), and another<br>
representing the Scandinavian branch of fewer characters with some<br>
different forms (referred to as the younger futhark). Division in<br>
this manner (encoding two separate sections of 31 and 24 characters)<br>
can be easily envisioned by comparing the four alphabets shown in<br>
the accompanying chart. Another obvious alternative would be to<br>
encode the entire set on phonemic principles (with minor variations),<br>
which would be equivalent (or nearly so) to a simple interwoven<br>
unification of the four aforementioned alphabets. All of the<br>
approaches seem to have disadvant<br>
</p>

<p>We here use the comparative Runic sets on the following pages (after<br>
Healey). One inconsistency introduced by division into two blocks<br>
is that the 4th Germanic rune (our composite number 4a) must still<br>
be distinguished from the 4th Anglo-Saxon rune (our number 7).<br>
Anglo-Saxon puts the Germanic 4th rune shape at its 26th location).</p>

<p>The only choice is to put one or the other out of alphabetical<br>
order. There are several other minor problems with the division,<br>
notably that our rune (composite number) 19a is used for two or<br>
more different sounds.</p>

<p>Implementation of Runes almost requires some standard method of<br>
indicating glyphic preference, as many of the Runic shapes seem to<br>
be free variants that probably make a great deal of difference to<br>
scholars, though legibility should not be impaired if normative<br>
forms are used.</p>

<p>Notes on the Runic Chart</p>

<p>This proposed composite block is based on a preliminary analysis<br>
of elements that clearly need to be distinguished within any one<br>
of the four idealized Runic alphabets (shown below). Some outstanding<br>
distinctions are these:</p>

<p>Runes 4a, 5, 7a both occur in the Anglo-Saxon Runes 4b, 6a both<br>
occur in the Danish Runes 10c occurs as a variant of 20a in the</p>

<p>Anglo-Saxon Rune 19a is ``m'' in the Danish, ``R'' (?) in the<br>
Germanic, ``x'' in the Anglo-Saxon Runes 13, 14a both occur in the</p>

<p>Anglo-Saxon Runes 21b, 25 both occur in Swedo-Norwegian (whereas<br>
elsewhere they might be used interchangeably for ``l'' in retrograde<br>
inscriptions)</p>

<h3>Epigraphic South Arabian</h3>

<p>The script known as South Arabian is related to the Proto-Canaanite<br>
and early Semitic alphabets, but the shapes are remarkably unique<br>
for such a derivation. It is also an ancestor of the modern Ethiopic<br>
script. Inscriptions in this script are found in Southern Arabia<br>
(ancient Sabaean and Minaean kingdoms) dating from as far back as<br>
500 BC. The script was apparently used until about 600 AD.</p>

<p>According to Healey (see below), the alphabetic order has been<br>
reconstructed on fragmentary evidence. The order given here follows<br>
that given by Healey.</p>

<p>The letters as 10 and 11 probably correspond to the Arabic hamzah<br>
and ain, but this is not certain from information currently available.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> The South Arabian alphabet could be arranged parallel to<br>
the Semitic alphabets. See the introduction to the Early Alphabet<br>
blocks for further discussion.</p>

<h3>Syriac</h3>

<p>The Syriac script is a later descendent of the Aramaic script.</p>

<p>The earliest known Syriac inscriptions are dated about 6 AD from<br>
near the town of Edessa to write the Aramaic dialect that became</p>

<p>Syriad. The Syriac script really represents a family of three<br>
closely related writing styles called Estrangela, Nestorian, and</p>

<p>Serta (the latter is also called Jacobite). The earliest form that<br>
became distinguished from Aramaic itself is Estrangela, developed<br>
about the 5th century AD. It was used extensively from the earliest<br>
times to record various Christian scriptures. The Syriac script<br>
is still in modern use. According to Healey (1990):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>``Syriac speaking communities have survived in large numbers in<br>
  the area around the point where the borders of Syria, Turkey,<br>
  and Iraq meet, and there are also emigr communities in Europe and the<br>
  United States. Books, magazines and newspapers are still produced<br>
  in the Syriac scripts.''</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Syriac scripts are generally cursive or semi-cursive, with some<br>
letters joining regularly to others and sometimes changing shape<br>
in a manner similar to the Arabic script. Vowel signs are known<br>
to exist, but available sources do not discuss them.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> The vowel signs at least must be added to complete <br>
the Syriac proposal. There seem to be at least two different non-spacing<br>
vowel systems: one is attributed to Jacob of Edessa and utilizes<br>
small letters written above or below others to indicate following<br>
vowels; the other is an older dotting system.</p>

<p>The chart shows in parallel the Mandaic alphabet (which includes<br>
the extra letter e at the end). It is not clear whether Mandaic<br>
should be unified with the Syriac block or not; it might be better<br>
encoded using the Aramaic block, or encoded separately.</p>

<p>Note that this order differs from the Early Phoenician and Aramic<br>
orders. It is not known whether waw in particular should come at<br>
the end, or at its place here.</p>

<h3>Tagalog and Mangyan (Buhid)</h3>

<p>Tagalog is a script of the Philippines. It was formerly used to<br>
write the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, and other languages. The Tagalog<br>
language is very much alive, but now utilizes the Latin script.</p>

<p>The Tagalog script is distantly related to the scripts of the<br>
southern Indian subcontinent, but the exact route by which they<br>
were brought to the Philippines is not certain. It seems that they<br>
may have been transported by way of the palaeographic scripts of<br>
Western Java between the 10th and 14th centuries. Written accounts<br>
of the Tagalog script by Spanish missionaries, and documents in</p>

<p>Tagalog, are known from about the period of initial Spanish incursion<br>
(mid-1500s). It has (or had) two living descendents the Mangyan<br>
and Tagbanuwa scripts both of which will be covered below.</p>

<p>Vowel signs are used in a manner similar to that employed by the<br>
scripts of the Indian subcontinent, from whence Tagalog seems to<br>
derive. The vowel I is written with a mark above, and the vowel<br>
U with an identical mark below the associated consonant. The mark<br>
looks like the sign ``&gt;''. It is known as kulit or tulbok in<br>
Mangyan and ulitan in Tagbanuwa. The script has only the two vowel<br>
signs I and U, which are also used respectively to stand for the<br>
vowels E and O. Though all languages normally written with this<br>
script have syllables possessing final consonants, they cannot be<br>
expressed in the script. Reforms to express final consonants or<br>
to add the missing vowel signs were apparently proposed at various<br>
times, but were always rejected by native users who considered the<br>
script adequate. Native speakers of Tagbanuwa, for instance,<br>
apparently have no trouble distinguishing uses of the vowel sign</p>

<p>I for the vowel e, or the sign U for o. In Tagalog there are<br>
several similar glyphs for the independent vowe</p>

<p>Tagalog is read from left to right in horizontal lines running from<br>
top to bottom. It may be written either in that manner, or in<br>
vertical lines running from bottom to top, moving from left to<br>
right. In the latter case, the letters are written sideways so<br>
they may be read horizontally. This method of writing may be due<br>
to the medium and writing implements used. It was often scratched<br>
with a sharp instrument onto beaten strips of bamboo which were<br>
held pointing away from the body and worked from the proximal to<br>
distal ends, from left to right.</p>

<p>Between words in Tagalog, a sign similar to double danda seems to<br>
be used (see the example in Nakanishi). The double danda is not<br>
included in the chart.</p>

<p>The alphabetical order of Tagalog is known from Tagbanuwa speakers<br>
and is described in folktales. This order is used in the accompanying<br>
charts. The two vowel signs are added at the end of the alphabet.</p>

<p>The accompanying chart is divided into three segments. The leftmost<br>
group are the forms used for classical Tagalog. The middle group,<br>
exactly paralleling the Tagalog, are the forms used for Tagbanuwa.<br>
The rightmost group are the forms used for Mangyan.</p>

<p><strong>Tagbanuwa: </strong>The Tagbanuwa letter forms are nearly the same as the<br>
old Tagalog forms, and the lineage is obvious as can be seen from<br>
the accompanying charts. Particularly different are the letters</p>

<p>I and KA. Modern Tagbanuwa does not use the letter HA, hence this<br>
spot is left blank in the Tagbanuwa chart.</p>

<p><strong>Mangyan:</strong> Mangyan is the term given to the Bongabon Mangyans, also<br>
known as Buhid or Bukid. The Mangyan letter forms differ significantly<br>
from their Tagalog counterparts. They were normally incised on<br>
bamboo, and the influence of the medium is unmistakably expressed<br>
in the angular letter forms. The vowel signs I and U are normally<br>
written as strokes attached to the main body of the associated<br>
consonant, in contrast to the Tagalog case for the same vowel signs.</p>

<p>A font for Mangyan might thus be completely ``unrolled'' as a<br>
syllabary, requiring about 50 distinct glyphs.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> It is known that Tagbanuwa and Mangyan were being actively<br>
used as recently as the early 1960s, as near as can be ascertained<br>
from evidence in Francisco's monograph. It is not known whether<br>
they are still being used as of this date (1992). It is unclear<br>
whether to classify them (and thus Tagalog) as living or extinct<br>
scripts. The extent to which their encoding is important to living<br>
communities is likewise uncertain.</p>

<p>Mangyan should perhaps be separately encoded from a Tagalog &amp; <br>
Tagbanuwa block due to (1) significant differences in nearly all<br>
letter forms and (2) the means by which vowel signs are attached<br>
and (3) as the two scripts are (or were) living side by side there<br>
may be a need for distinguishing them in plaintext, (4) either one<br>
may not be readable by those unfamiliar with the other.</p>

<h3>Tai Lu (Chieng Mai, Northern Thai)</h3>

<p>The Tai Lu script is widely used for various Tai dialects in northern Thailand, Yunnan,
and parts of Burma (they are variously referred<br>
to as Lannathai, Yuan, or Kam Muang). The Tai Lu script is of the Indic variety, and is
structurally similar to both the Thai and Burmese scripts to which the affinities can be
easily seen in the<br>
forms. The script is also known by the name Northern Thai;<br>
neither name seems to be a standard. The script referred to as<br>
Chieng Mai by Nakanishi is a fancier typographical form of the Tai<br>
Lu script, and hence included here.</p>

<p>The language known as Tai Lu is in use in northern Thailand and in<br>
Yunnan province of China. There are about 1 million living speakers<br>
of Tai Lu, and this script is officially recognized by the Chinese<br>
government.</p>

<p>Each Tai Lu consonant has an inherent vowel and (apparently) an<br>
inherent tone. Most of the consonants contain an inherent ``o''<br>
vowel (or ``a''?), but some seem to contain other inherent vowels.</p>

<p>There are 41 consonants, five stand-alone vowels, and 32 vowel<br>
signs. The vowel system of the Northern Thai language is very<br>
complex, so the script contains a correspondingly large number of<br>
vowel signs, though some of them are written as compounds of simpler<br>
graphic symbols.</p>

<p>The traditional order of the consonants as given by Davis is<br>
distinctly different from the typical Devanagari order (for instance,<br>
the aspirated letters all come before the associated unaspirated<br>
ones, while Devanagari order is the opposite).</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> This draft is nowhere near complete as not enough is known<br>
at this time and sources are currently scarce. The chart is thought<br>
to contain a complete repertoire of possible candidates for encoding,<br>
except for punctuation and digits.</p>

<p>The vowel system could be greatly reduced by removing several<br>
compound vowel signs and manufacturing these vowels from simpler<br>
vowels and glyphic fragments. The glottal stop consonant itself<br>
is a component of the graphic representation of two other vowel<br>
signs.</p>

<p>The letters at codepoints 1B, 1D, 1E, 1F may be conjuncts of some<br>
type involving 18 together with other letters. Perhaps: MA=1B=18+13,<br>
LA=1D=18+14, NYA=1E=18+07, NGA=1F=18+03.</p>

<p>The names list is fully inadequate for any purpose except unique<br>
identification. The names were generated by taking Davis's pseudo-IPA<br>
transliterations and formulating unique names from them, while<br>
utilizing only the symbols allowed in ISO names.</p>

<p>Because the order cited by Davis differs so significantly from the<br>
Devanagari order, the utility and correctness of this order should<br>
be corroborated by other sources.</p>

<h3>Tai Mau, Tai Nua</h3>

<p>The Tai Mau or Tai Nua script is a recent invention that is reported<br>
to have been in use only since 1940. It is apparently used for<br>
writing several Shan languages within China (Yunnan) and Northeastern</p>

<p>Burma (between the Nam Mau and Salween rivers). The Tai Mau script<br>
was invented (revised?), apparently, as a reaction to a reported<br>
revision of another script used by the Tai Tai (Burma).</p>

<p>This script is remarkably simpler in structure than those used for<br>
standard Thai and Northern Thai (see Thai and Tai Lu block<br>
introductions). It has many different attributes when considered<br>
as a relative of those scripts, mostly in the features which it<br>
lacks: it has no non-spacing tone marks, non-spacing vowel signs,<br>
re-ordering matras, or conjunct consonant glyphs to name but a few.</p>

<p>It has only two floating marks; all other symbols are normal spacing<br>
characters. The alphabetic order of the consonants is similar to<br>
the typical Indic order.</p>

<p>Tai Mau is written from left to right (with spaces between words?<br>
syllables?). Each syllable begins with a consonant (or glottal<br>
stop?) followed by a vowel, any final stop follows the vowel, and<br>
finally comes a tone mark. Tone marks are spacing characters; the<br>
first tone is indicated by absence of any other tone mark. There<br>
are no special symbols for final consonants: consonants are known<br>
to be final stops by virtue of their position within a syllable<br>
after a vowel, since all vowels are explicitly marked. (is that<br>
strictly true?). As in the Indic systems, the consonants also<br>
contain an inherent conceptual vowel. This inherent vowel in Tai<br>
Mau represents both the vowel ``a'' and a glottal stop. To write<br>
the vowel ``a'' without glottal stop, a special symbol (like a<br>
lowercase `b') is used.</p>

<p>Foreign sounds are expressed principally through use of a non-spacing<br>
dot. This dot may be written either on the upper right shoulder<br>
of a vowel, or below the vowel, to shorten its value. Placing the<br>
dot over the tone symbol indicates a rising tone; and placing it<br>
below the tone symbol indicates a falling tone. Voiced consonants<br>
are written by applying the dot under a consonant (e.g., to turn<br>
`k' into 'g'). More than one final stop may be written by putting<br>
a dot above the 2nd (and nth) final consonants of a syllable.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> Several issues are framed as questions in the paragraphs<br>
above. The script seems, from the available sources, to be<br>
deceptively simple. It is not known at all how widely this system<br>
is currently used, but it is assuredly in modern use. Punctuation<br>
and word spacing and so forth are currently unknown.</p>

<p>There are some diphthongs that are written with combinations of<br>
primitive vowel signs followed by ``sha1'', and some diphthongs<br>
written with combinations of primitive vowel signs followed by what<br>
appears to be the consonant WA. The diphthong listed as ``ai bar''<br>
in the names list is written with a unique symbol that looks like<br>
the vowel sign AA, but has the hook to the right; it is not clear<br>
whether this is an error in the source or not.</p>

<p>There is no ``tone mark 1'' in the chart or names list since the<br>

<h3>Ugaritic Cuneiform</h3>

<p>The city state of Ugarit was an important seaport on the Phoenician<br>
coast (directly east of Cyprus, north of the modern town of Minet<br>
el-Beida) from about 1400 BC until it was completely destroyed in<br>
the 12th century BC. The site of Ugarit, now called Ras esh-Shamra,<br>
was apparently continuously occupied from Neolithic times (ca. 5000<br>
BC). It was first uncovered by a local inhabitant while ploughing<br>
a field in 1928, and subsequently excavated by Claude Schaeffer<br>
and Georges Chenet beginning in 1929, in which year the first of<br>
many tablets written in the Ugaritic script were discovered. They<br>
later proved to contain extensive portions of an important Canaanite<br>
mythological and religious literature that had long been sought<br>
and which revolutionized Biblical studies. The script was first<br>
deciphered in a remarkably short time jointly by Hans Bauer, douard<br>
Dhorme, and Charles Virolleaud.</p>

<p>The Ugaritic language is Semitic, variously regarded by scholars<br>
as being a distinct language related to Akkadian and Canaanite, or<br>
a Canaanite dialect. Ugaritic is generally written from left to<br>
right horizontally, sometimes with a vertical stroke between words.</p>

<p>In the city of Ugarit, this script was also used to write the</p>

<h3>Hurrian language.</h3>

<p>Glyphs for T-Underbar, G-Acute, and D-Underbar differ somewhat<br>
between modern reference sources (as do some transliterations).</p>

<p>T-Underbar is most often displayed with a glyph that looks like an<br>
occurrence of Glottal Stop overlaid with G. The Unicode block for<br>
Ugaritic is in the order that was apparently standard; it coincides<br>
for the mostpart with Phoenician and Early Hebrew order.</p>

<p>Ugaritic cuneiform is thought to be complete in this encoding; it<br>
is a syllabic script and should not be confused with the ideographic<br>
cuneiform scripts of Akkadian and Sumerian derivation. There may<br>
be relatives of the Ugaritic script used for other Canaanite<br>
languages at about the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong> Because the Ugaritic language was Semitic, and therefore<br>
the script contains syllables which somewhat echo the Semitic<br>
alphabets, it has been suggested that scholars could benefit were<br>
it to be encoded in phonetic parallel to the Hebrew script.</p>

<h3>Other Scripts (Without Specific Proposals)</h3>

<p>There are, of course, a number of other scripts for which proposals<br>
have not been made. Some of these will be described in this section.</p>

<p>Further information about these scripts is welcome. Scholars<br>
interested in pursuing the encoding of any of these may contact<br>
the Unicode offices. In the following thumbnail sketches, when it<br>
is written that a particular item ``is not known,'' this usually<br>
means that the relevant information has not yet been found by<br>
members of the Unicode Consortium working on these issues, rather<br>
than that the information is really not known.</p>

<h3>Brahmi and Other Scripts of India</h3>

<p>The Brahmi script is the progenitor of all or most of the scripts<br>
of India, as well as most scripts of Southeast Asia. Brahmi is<br>
also known as Asoka, the script in which the famous Asokan edicts<br>
were incised in the second century BC. (Asoka was an emperor of<br>
the Mauryan dynasty of what is now Orissa State, India.) Brahmi<br>
is historically important, but not enough information is currently<br>
available to make a concrete proposal beyond a mere list of the<br>
basic alphabet (e.g., for which see Diringer's Writing). Unlike<br>
most of its modern descendants, Brahmi vowel signs are written in<br>
an attached form, and the script thus requires a large number of<br>
glyphs for rendering.</p>

<p>The so-called Box-Headed Script was used in India during the 6th<br>
century AD. It appears in many stone inscriptions around Hyderabad<br>
in central India. Several other old Indian scripts are known to<br>
exist (Modi, Kaithi, Satavahana, Chola, Kharoshthi, Lahnda) but<br>
not enough information is currently available about them to evaluate<br>
their content and historical importance. They may eventually be<br>
encoded.</p>

<h3>'Phags-pa</h3>

<p>The 'Phags-pa script an extinct fore-runner of the Tibetan script,<br>
is traditionally held to have been invented in about 1269 by Bla-ma<br>
'Phags-pa. It was used in Mongolia throughout the Yan dynasty and<br>
(reportedly) was the official script of the Mongolian empire under<br>
Kublai Khan. 'Phags-pa can be viewed as mostly parallel to the<br>
modern Tibetan script, but it was written vertically and contained<br>
several letters not found in Tibetan.</p>

<h3>Ancient Egyptian (Hieroglyphic)</h3>

<p>The Egyptian hieroglyphic script is well-known and historically<br>
important; it is also well-studied by scholars and frequently<br>
requested for addition to Unicode. The major problem to solve is<br>
determining the extent to which variant forms should be unified<br>
into a single codepoint, relying on richer text handling mechanisms<br>
for rendering and glyphic choice. The Gardner set of glyphs contains<br>
some 750 entities from a late hieroglyphic period. French scholars<br>
have compiled some 9000 entities spanning from the earliest to<br>
latest inscriptions; of these 9000, one preliminary estimate suggests<br>
that only about 2000 should really be distinct characters, the<br>
other 7000 are variant forms. A clear model needs to be developed<br>
that can give a coherent picture of the historical periods involved,<br>
and how various periods can be reflected in the final rendering<br>
and processing models. So far, no work has been done in this area.</p>

<p>This problem is of similar magnitude to the ``Han unification''<br>
problem.</p>

<h3>Akkadian / Babylonian / Sumerian</h3>

<p>The Egyptian hieroglyphic problem is probably closely matched by<br>
the problems involved in the Akkadian, Sumerian, and Babylonian<br>
cuneiform systems. One existing Akkadian font lists over 700 signs.</p>

<p>The Manuel d'Epigraphie Akkadienne has not been available for<br>
preliminary consultation (it has been purchased, but we have yet<br>
to receive it as of this writing). Akkadian was a lingua franca<br>
over much of the ancient Middle East for well over a thousand years,<br>
and its historical importance is uncontested, but again, there is<br>
an historical problem of considerable magnitude to be solved before<br>
encoding it.</p>

<h3>Hittite Hieroglyphics</h3>

<p>The Hittite language written with a unique hieroglyphic system is<br>
the oldest recorded Indo-European language. The Hittite hieroglyphics<br>
came to light gradually during the latter half of the 19th century.</p>

<p>There are some 110 signs or so. Many of these are listed in various<br>
readily-available sources, but we have not yet found source materials<br>
showing all of the known signs or expounding more than cursorily<br>
upon the hieroglyphic system. Hittite was also written at one time<br>
in a later form of Akkadian cuneiform; it is not known to what<br>
extent the glyphs used for cuneiform Hittite overlap exactly with<br>
particular Akkadian glyphs.</p>

<h3>Kawi / Javanese / Balinese</h3>

<p>It is not clear at this time whether Kawi, Javanese, and Balinese<br>
scripts are distinct enough entities to require separate encoding,<br>
or whether a single encoding with three different font presentations<br>
will suffice. The Javanese script is known to enjoy some sporadic<br>
use, and some information on it (the shapes and phonetic values of<br>
its basic letters, from Faulmann and other sources) is readily<br>
available. Kawi is basically an extinct language, but it is known<br>
to still enjoy some use at least in traditional Balinese theatre<br>
(see, e.g., McPhee, Music in Bali where the Kawi language is<br>
mentioned repeatedly as the language of vocal recitation for much<br>
theatre music). It is unknown to what extent either the Kawi or<br>
Balinese scripts are in use, however.</p>

<h3>Ahom / Khamti</h3>

<p>Ahom is a recently extinct Shan language. The Ahom and Khamti<br>
scripts appear in the Linguistic Survey of India (see below), where<br>
there is enough information to quickly generate an exploratory<br>
proposal. Hearsay suggests, however, that a new book on the Ahom<br>
language (and script?) is forthcoming; this could be expected to<br>
contain much better information. It is unknown how much current<br>
scholarly interest there is in encoding of the Ahom and Khamti<br>
scripts.</p>

<h3>Pyu / Tircul</h3>

<p>The Pyu script is another descendant of Brahmi that was used in</p>

<p>Burma sometime between about 800 and 1000 AD. It is described<br>
somewhat in Luce (see below), where there is a large chart that<br>
gives a good idea of the letter shapes and the repertoire, but is<br>
too scanty for even an exploratory proposal.</p>

<h3>Yi (Lolo)</h3>

<p>The Yi or Lolo script is known to be in use among the Yi people of<br>
Yunnan Province in China. The modern Yi script is a syllabary<br>
containing hundreds of symbols. Each symbol seems to encode a<br>
syllable and one of three tones. A table of this script is available.</p>

<p>The system seems to be a revision of an older syllabic/ideographic<br>
system about which little information is available. Some further<br>
other information is contained in Vial (see below).</p>

<h3>Moso (a.k.a. Naxi, Nahsi, Nakhi)</h3>

<p>The Moso or Naxi script is used among the Moso people of China.</p>

<p>It is apparently an ideographic script (with many beautiful and<br>
detailed glyphs), and may still be in use as of this writing. It<br>
was apparently in use as late as 1981. Bacot shows a large number<br>
of ideographs, with brief synopses of meaning. This information<br>
is adequate to get an idea of the number of symbols and their type,<br>
but more information is needed to generate an exploratory proposal.</p>

<p>One volume in Chinese (1981) is available and lists some 1340<br>
graphic units, though this number must be augmented because several<br>
dissimilar graphic elements are often recorded and defined under<br>
one numbered entry.</p>

<h3>Siddham</h3>

<p>The Siddham script is closely related to Devanagari. It is still<br>
widely used as an art form (calligraphy) in connection with Buddhism<br>
in Japan and the Far East. Excellent sources, such as Stevens (see<br>
bibliography) are available, and a proposal could be quickly<br>
generated.</p>

<h3>Linear A and Others</h3>

<p>Several other scripts are known from the Middle East. Among these<br>
are Linear A and the Cypriot Syllabary (or Cypro-Minoan). They are<br>
both related to Linear B but the extent of the connection is not<br>
clear enough to decide whether they could or should be encoded in<br>
parallel to Linear B or unified with Linear B, or encoded separately.</p>

<p>Not much information is available on the so-called ``pseudo-<br>
hieroglyphic'' script of Byblos.</p>
