  <h2>1 <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
  <p>The Unicode Character Database (UCD) is a collection of data files which contain the Unicode character code points and character names and which define the Unicode character properties and mappings between Unicode characters (such as case mappings).
  </p>
  <p>This annex describes the UCD and provides a guide to the various documentation files associated with it.
  </p>
  <p>The current version of the UCD is always located on the Unicode Web site at:
  </p>
  <p>
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/">http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/</a>
  </p>
  <p>The specific files for the UCD associated with this version of the Unicode Standard (5.1.0) are located at:
  </p>
  <p>
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/5.1.0/">http://www.unicode.org/Public/5.1.0/</a>
  </p>
  <p>Stable, archived versions of the UCD associated with all earlier versions of the Unicode Standard can be accessed from: </p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.unicode.org/ucd/">http://www.unicode.org/ucd/</a> </p>
  <p>See Section 4.1, "Unicode Character Database", in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-3.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] for a general discussion of the UCD and its use in defining properties.
  </p>
 <h2>2 <a name="Conformance">Conformance</a></h2>
 <p>The Unicode Character Database is an integral part of the Unicode Standard.</p>
<p>The UCD contains normative property and mapping information required for implementation of various Unicode algorithms such as the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm, Unicode Normalization, and Unicode Casefolding. The data files also contain additional informative and provisional character property information.</p>
<p>Each specification of a Unicode algorithm, whether specified in the text of [<a href="../tr41/tr41-3.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] or in one of the Unicode Standard Annexes, designates which data file(s) in the UCD are required for providing normative property information required by that algorithm.</p>
<p>For information on the meaning and application of the terms&nbsp; <i>normative, informative</i>, and 
<i>provisional</i>, see Section 3.5, &quot;Properties" in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-3.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
<h3>2.1 <a name="Simple_Derived_html">Simple and Derived Properties</a></h3>
<p>Some character properties in the UCD are simple properties.
This status has no bearing on whether or not the properties are
normative, but merely indicates that their values
are not derived from some combination of other properties.</p>

<p>Other character properties are derived. This means that
their values are derived by rule from some other
combination of properties. Generally such rules are
stated as set operations, and may or may not include
explicit exception lists for individual characters.</p>

<p>Sometimes simple properties are defined merely
to make the statement of the rule defining a derived
property more compact or general. Such properties are
known as <i>contributory properties</i> and typically
have their names prefixed by "Other_". Sometimes
these contributory properties are defined to
encapsulate the messiness inherent in exception
lists. At other times, a contributory property may
be defined to help stabilize the definition of
an important derived property which is subject to stability
guarantees.</p>

<p>Derived character properties are not considered
second-class citizens among Unicode character properties.
They are defined to make implementation of important
algorithms easier to state. Included among the
first-class derived properties important for such
implementations are: Uppercase, Lowercase, XID_Start,
XID_Continue, Math, and Default_Ignorable_Code_Point, all
defined in DerivedCoreProperties.txt, and derived
properties for optimization of normalization, defined
in DerivedNormalizationProps.txt.</p>

<p>Implementations should simply use the derived properties,
and should not try to rederive them from lists of simple
properties and collections of rules, because of the
chances for error and divergence when doing so.</p>

<p>If there are any cases of mismatches
between the definition of a derived property as
listed in DerivedCoreProperties.txt or similar data
files in the UCD, and the definition of a derived
property as a set definition rule, the explicit
listing in the data file should <i>always</i> be taken
as the normative definition of the property.</p>

<p>Definitions of property derivations are provided
for information only, typically in comment fields
in the data files. Such definitions may be refactored,
refined, or corrected over time. To ensure
that there is never any ambiguity between versions
of the standard, even if the definition of a derivation
is changed at some point in time, the exact property
listing in the data files for any given version
of the standard is always the truth for that property
value for that version&#x2014;and will itself never change
for that version.</p>

<h2>3 <a name="Documentation_Files">Documentation Files</a></h2>The UCD also contains a number of documentation files, which provide information about the UCD as a whole, and about file formats, status, derivation of derived properties, and various other information. 
<h3>3.1 <a name="UCD_html">UCD.html</a></h3>
<p>UCD.html is the most important of the documentation files. It provides a complete listing of the UCD data files and character properties. It indicates which properties are normative and where they are defined. It provides further information required for the proper interpretation of some of the Unicode character properties.</p>
<p>UCD.html also records the modification history for the data files in the UCD, noting changes from version to version of the standard.</p>
<h3>3.2 <a name="NamesList_html">NamesList.html</a></h3>
<p>NamesList.html formally describes (in BNF) the format of the NamesList.txt data file, the file which is used to drive the printing of the Unicode code charts and names list. See also Section 17.1, "Character Names List", in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-3.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] for a detailed discussion of the conventions used in the names list.</p>
<h3>3.3 <a name="Unihan_html">Unihan.html and UAX #38</a></h3>
<p>Unihan.html describes the format and content of Unihan.txt, the data file which collects together all property information for CJK Unified Ideographs. As of Version 5.1.0 of the Unicode Standard, the content of Unihan.html has been incorporated into the new [<a href="../tr41/tr41-3.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>], which is intended to supersede Unihan.html.</p>
<h3>3.4 <a name="StandardizedVariants_html">StandardizedVariants.html</a></h3>
<p>StandardizedVariants.html documents standardized variants, showing a representative glyph for each. It is closely tied to the data file, StandardizedVariants.txt , which  defines those sequences normatively.</p>
<h3>3.5. <a name="Data_File_Comments">Data File Comments</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the specific documentation files for the UCD, individual data 
files often contain extensive header comments describing their content and any 
special conventions used in the data. In some instances, individual property 
definition sections are also commented with information about how the property 
may be derived.</p>
  <h2>4 <a name="Test_Files">Test Files</a></h2>
  <p>The UCD also contains a number of test data files, 
which specify, in standard formats, data which can be used to test 
implementation of Unicode algorithms. </p> 
  <h3>4.1. <a name= "NormalizationTest_txt"> NormalizationTest.txt </a></h3> 
  <p>This file contains data which can be used to test an implementation of the 
  Unicode Normalization Algorithm. (See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-3.html#UAX15">UAX15</a>].) </p>
<h3>4.2. <a name= "LineBreakTest_txt">LineBreakTest.txt</a></h3>
<p>This file, located in the auxiliary directory of the UCD, contains data which can be used 
to test an implementation of the Unicode Linebreaking Algorithm. (See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-3.html#LineBreak">UAX14</a>].) 
  </p>
<p>There is an associated documentation file, LineBreakTest.html, which displays 
the results of the Linebreaking Algorithm in an interactive chart form, with a 
documented listing of the rules. </p>
<h3>4.3. <a name= "Segmentation_Test_Files">Segmentation Test Files</a></h3>
  <p>The following three data files are also located in the auxiliary directory of the UCD: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>GraphemeBreakTest.txt</li>
    <li>SentenceBreakTest.txt</li>
    <li>WordBreakTest.txt</li>
  </ul>
  <p>They 
  contain data which can be used to test an implementation of the segmentation 
  algorithms specified in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-3.html#UAX29">UAX29</a>]. </p>
  <p>There are also associated documentation 
  files, which display the results of the segmentation algorithms in an 
  interactive chart form, with a documented listing of the rules: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>GraphemeBreakTest.html </li>
    <li>SentenceBreakTest.html </li>
    <li>WordBreakTest.html&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>5 <a name="UCD_in_XML">UCD in XML</a></h2>
  <p>[<a href="../tr41/tr41-3.html#UAX42">UAX42</a>] defines an XML schema 
which is used to incorporate all of the Unicode character property information 
into an XML version of the UCD.  </p>
  <p>Starting with Version 5.1.0, a set of XML data 
files using that schema are also released with each version of the UCD. Those 
data files make it possible to import and process the UCD property data using 
standard XML parsing tools, instead of the specialized parsing required for the 
various individual data files of the UCD. <br>
