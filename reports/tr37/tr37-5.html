         </h2>

         <p xmlns="">Characters in the Unicode Standard can be represented by a
    wide variety of glyphs. Occasionally the need arises in text
    processing to restrict or change the set of glyphs that are to be
    used to display a character. In special circumstances, this
    restriction needs to be expressed in plain text rather than by
    font selection or some other rich text mechanism. The Unicode
    Standard accommodates those circumstances with variation selectors:
    the code point of a graphic character can be followed by the code
    point of a variation selector to identify a restriction on the
    graphic character. The combination of a graphic character and a
    variation selector is known as a variation sequence (See
    <i>Section 15.6, Variation Selectors</i> of
    <i>[<a href="tr37-5.html#biblio_unicode">Unicode</a>]</i>).</p>


         <p xmlns="">In the case of Han ideographs, it is impossible to build a
    single collection of variation sequences that can satisfy all the
    needs of the users. The requirements from scholars, governments
    and publishers are too different to be accommodated by a single
    collection. Instead they can be met by having multiple independent
    collections. The Ideographic Variation database ensures that a
    given variation sequence is used in at most one collection, to
    make interchange of text using such variation sequences
    reliable.</p>
  
         <h2 xmlns="">
            <a name="w1aab9b1">2 Description</a>
         </h2>

         <p xmlns="">An <i>Ideographic Variation Sequence (IVS)</i>
    is a sequence of two coded characters, the first being a character
    with the Unified_Ideograph property, the second being a variation
    selector character in the range U+E0100 to U+E01EF.</p>

         <p xmlns="">A <i>glyphic subset</i> for a given character
    is a subset of the glyphs that are appropriate for displaying that
    character.</p>

         <p xmlns="">The purpose of the <i>Ideographic Variation Database
    (IVD)</i> is to associate an IVS with a unique glyphic
    subset. An IVS which is present in the database is a
    <i>registered IVS;</i> one can determine reliably
    the intent of such IVSes when they occur in text by consulting the
    database, thus those IVSes are suitable for use in text
    interchange.</p>

         <p xmlns="">IVSes are subject to the usual rules for variation
    sequences: unregistered IVSes (which are not in the database)
    should not be used in text interchange, and registered IVSes
    should be used only to restrict the rendering of their unified
    ideograph to the glyphic subset associated with the IVS in the
    database. Furthermore, variation selectors are default
    ignorable. This implies that registrants are expected to ensure
    that the glyphic subset associated with an IVS is indeed a subset
    of the glyphs which are acceptable for the base character
    alone. Stated another way, the shapes in the glyphic subset of an
    IVS should be unifiable with the base character of that IVS. One
    possible way to determine this is to consider the unification
    rules for Han ideographs; see <i>[<a href="tr37-5.html#biblio_unicode">Unicode</a>]</i>,
    section 12.1 Han, and <i>[<a href="tr37-5.html#biblio_10646">ISO 10646</a>]</i>, annex
    S.</p>

         <p xmlns="">To guarantee the stability of texts using registered IVSes,
    the association between an IVS and a glyphic subset is permanent:
    an IVS is never reassigned to another glyphic subset.</p>

         <p xmlns="">While the IVD guarantees that a registered IVS corresponds
    to a single glyphic subset, and that this association is permanent,
    it does not guarantee that two different IVSes on the same unified
    ideograph have non-overlapping or even distinct glyphic
    subsets.</p>

         <p xmlns="">There is no guarantee that two IVSes using the same
    variation selector but on different unified ideographs have any
    relationship, nor will a variation selector be designated for a
    purpose independently of any base. For example, if some IVS using U+E0100
    captures a restriction on the display of left component of its
    base ideograph, some other IVS also using U+E0100 could capture a
    restriction on the display of the right component of its base
    ideograph; and therefore, the effect of U+E0100 does not need to
    be uniform in all the IVSes it is part of.</p>

         <p xmlns="">Should there be a requirement to register more than 240
    IVSes involving the same unified ideograph, the Unicode Consortium
    will begin the process of encoding additional variation selectors,
    and make those available for registration of Ideographic Variation
    Sequences.</p>

         <p xmlns="">To facilitate the organization and use of the IVD,
    registered IVSes are grouped in collections. This facilitates
    tracking the glyphic subset associated with an IVS, which is
    identified as an entry in a collection. It is also expected that
    the glyphic subsets in a given collection have been selected so
    that as an aggregate, they satisfy the requirements of a given
    user community.</p>

         <p xmlns="">Registration of a collection does not imply suitability for
    any purpose. The usefulness of a given variation sequence and the
    usefulness of a collection as a whole depend to a large extent on
    their use. Registrants are encouraged to describe the intent of
    their collections, and users are encouraged to evaluate
    whether a collection is useful for their purpose.</p>

         <p xmlns="">While the registration process requires that variation
    sequences be described at the time they are registered, and it
    strongly encourages the registrant to continue providing public
    access to that description for as long as possible, it cannot
    guarantee that this will be case. Users of registered sequences
    should carefully evaluate whether the continuing public
    availability of the description is necessary for their purpose,
    and whether the registrant of the relevant sequences can provide
    it.</p>
  
         <h2 xmlns="">
            <a name="w1aac11b1">3 Format of the Ideographic Variation Database</a>
         </h2>

         <p xmlns="">The Ideographic Variation Database consists of two data
    files. The first, IVD_Collections.txt records the registered
    collections. The second, IVD_Sequences.txt records the registered
    sequences.</p>

         <p xmlns="">In each file, lines starting with a '#' character and empty
    lines are comment lines. The other lines are organized into
    fields, separated by a semicolon; initial and trailing white space
    in those fields is not significant. Both files are encoded in
    UTF-8, using U+000A as the line separator. Both files must end
    with a comment line “# EOF”.</p>

         <p xmlns="">In IVD_Collections.txt, each line corresponds to an Ideographic
    Variation Collection, and there are three fields per line:</p>

         <ul xmlns="">
            <li>
	              <p>field 1: the identifier of a collection</p>
            </li>
            <li>
	              <p>field 2: a regular expression for the identifiers within
	the collection; all such identifiers must match that
	regular expression. Over time,
	this regular expression may be extended, as new identifiers
	are used in the collection.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
	              <p>field 3: the URL of a site describing the collection</p>
            </li>
         </ul>

         <p xmlns="">In IVD_Sequences.txt, each line corresponds to an Ideographic
    Variation Sequence and there are three fields per line:</p>

         <ul xmlns="">
            <li>
	              <p>field 1: the code points of the base character and the
	variation selector, separated by a space</p>
            </li>
            <li>
	              <p>field 2: the identifier of the collection under which the
	sequence is registered</p>
            </li>
            <li>
	              <p>field 3: the identifier of the sequence, provided by the
	registrant; this identifier must match the regular expression
	for the collection</p>
            </li>
         </ul>

         <p xmlns="">The identifiers for collections and sequences are character
    strings starting with one of 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', and continuing
    with one of 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '0'..'9', '_'. The regular
    expressions for identifiers conform to Perl 5.8 regular
    expressions <i>[<a href="tr37-5.html#biblio_perl">Perl</a>]</i>.</p>
  
         <h2 xmlns="">
            <a name="w1aac13b1">4 Registration Procedure</a>
         </h2>

         <p xmlns="">The Ideographic Variation Database is populated by
    submitting registration requests to a registration authority. The
    first step is to register a collection. After this is done,
    individual glyphic subsets can be registered in the context of
    that collection.</p>

    
         <h3 xmlns="">
            <a name="w1aac13b5b1">4.1 Registration of a Collection</a>
         </h3>

         <p xmlns="">The registrant must first create a web page describing the
      intent of the collection, its principles, and any other data
      that may be useful for users of the collection.</p>

         <p xmlns="">Once the appropriate page is online, the intent to
      register the collection must be announced publicly in a manner
      designated by the registrar and sent to the general
      Unicode e-mail distribution list <i>[<a href="tr37-5.html#biblio_distlist">DistList</a>]</i>. This announcement must include the
      URL of the page(s) describing the proposed collection. This
      starts a review period of at least 90 days, during which
      comments and questions about the collection can be submitted to
      the registrant. The registrant should respond to these comments
      and questions.</p>

         <p xmlns="">At the end of the review period, the registrant can submit
      the registration form in <a href="tr37-5.html#registration_form">Appendix
      A</a>, together with a written and signed statement that:</p>

         <ul xmlns="">
	           <li>
	              <p>the registrant will make reasonable efforts to
	  maintain the stability of that URL and the site it points
	  to</p>
	           </li>

	           <li>
	              <p>the variation sequences that will be registered in
	  that collection can be used freely, without any limitation,
	  fee or other requirement</p>
	           </li>

	           <li>
	              <p>all the comments and questions received during the
	  review period have been addressed</p>
	           </li>
         </ul>

         <p xmlns="">Upon receipt of a complete application and the applicable
      fee if any, the registrar will assign a collection identifier
      (respecting as much as possible the suggested identifier), and
      add the collection to the Ideographic Variation Database.</p>

         <p xmlns="">Owners of collections can change the designated
      representative at any time by notifying the registrar. They can
      also change the URL of the web site they maintain by notifying
      the registrar. Ownership of a collection can be transferred to
      another party by notifying the registrar.</p>

         <p xmlns="">The registration of sequences in that collection can be
      started concurrently with the registration of the collection
      itself.</p>
    

    
         <h3 xmlns="">
            <a name="w1aac13b7b1">4.2 Registration of Sequences in a Collection</a>
         </h3>

         <p xmlns="">The registrant must first include the proposed sequences
      in the web page describing the collection (or some page pointing
      from it). Ideally, this description should include
      representative glyphs for proposed sequences.</p>

         <p xmlns="">Once the page is online, the intent to register the
      sequences must be announced publicly in a manner designated by
      the registrar and sent to the general Unicode e-mail
      distribution list <i>[<a href="tr37-5.html#biblio_distlist">DistList</a>]</i>. This
      announcement must include the URL of the page(s) describing the
      proposed sequences. This starts a review period of at least 90
      days, during which comments and questions about the sequences
      can be submitted to the registrant.  The registrant should
      respond to these comments and questions.</p>

         <p xmlns="">At the end of the review period, the registrant can submit
      the application for those sequences. This takes the form of a
      file in the format of IVD_Sequences.txt, except that the first
      field must contain only the code point of the base
      character. The registrant is
      responsible for ensuring that sequence identifiers are unique
      <i>within</i> the collection, including sequences
      previously registered in that collection, and that they match
      the regular expression for sequence identifiers in the
      collection. An application that does not respect these rules
      will be rejected.</p>

         <p xmlns="">Upon receipt of a complete application and the applicable
      fee if any, the registrar will assign a variation selector for
      each variation sequence, and add the sequences to the
      Ideographic Variation Database.</p>

         </h3>

         <p xmlns="">Unicode Inc. will be the registration authority for this

         <h3 xmlns="">
            <a name="w1aac13c11b1">4.4 Registration Fees</a>
         </h3>

         <p xmlns="">The registration authority may impose a non-refundable
      processing fee for the registration of collections and
      sequences. If a registration application is incomplete, the
      registrar will inform the registrant and accept one corrected
      application at no fee. Further corrections to the application
      may require an additional fee.</p>

         <p xmlns="">The Unicode Consortium may register collections or
      sequences at any time without any processing fee.</p>

         </h2>

         <p xmlns="">This appendix presents an hypothetical example, where it is
    desirable to express in plain text that the display of a character
    occurrence should be restricted.</p>

    
         <h2 xmlns="">
            <a name="w1aac17b5b1">1 The Situation</a>
         </h2>

         <p xmlns="">Consider the unified ideograph U+82A6
      <i>ashi;</i> this character can be appropriately
      rendered by a number of different glyphs:</p>

         <center xmlns="">
	
	           <img src="u82a6.png" alt="Four different glyphs for U+82A6"/>
	  
         </center>
      
         <p xmlns="">In the following Japanese sentence (which means roughly
      “Ms. Ashida is a young lady from Ashiya”), this
      character occurs twice. The first occurrence could be displayed
      with any of those four glyphs, and it is therefore not necessary
      to express any restriction in plain text; the character U+82A6
      alone is enough, and usual font selection mechanisms can take
      care of selecting a glyph appropriate for the context (typically
      3 in modern Japanese). On the other hand, the second occurrence
      is in the name of the town Ashiya, and it is customarily
      displayed with an older form (4) of the character.</p>

         <center xmlns="">
	
	           <img src="sentence.png" alt="芦田さんは芦屋のお嬢様だ"/>
	  
         </center>
    

    
         <h2 xmlns="">
            <a name="w1aac17b7b1">2 Describing the Collection and its Content</a>
         </h2>

         <p xmlns="">Assuming that some party “Example” wishes to
      express the restriction above in plain text, they would create a
      collection for this kind of situation. This collection could be
      targeted at the representation of person and place names, for
      example. They would put a description of this collection on
      their web site, at “http://www.example.com/names”,
      which could look like this:</p>

         <blockquote xmlns="">
	           <p>This collection of glyphic subsets is intended for the
	representation of person and place names in Japanese. Elements
	in this collection are identified by an integer (i.e. match
	the regular expression “[0-9]+”).</p>

	           <p>It currently contains a single glyphic subset:</p>

	           <p>Base Unified Ideograph: U+82A6</p>
	           <p>Identifier in this collection: 23</p>
	           <p>Glyphic subset: there is a single horizontal stroke in
	the radical; the top stroke below the radical is attached and
	slanting up. Thus <img src="u82a6-in.png" alt="glyph 4 for U+82A6"/> is in
	the glyphic subset, and
	<img src="u82a6-out.png" alt="glyphs 1 through 3 for U+82A6"/> are
	not</p>
         </blockquote>

    

    
         <h2 xmlns="">
            <a name="w1aac17b9b1">3 The IVD</a>
         </h2>

         <p xmlns="">Assuming a successful registration, the collection could
      be assigned a name like “Example_names”; the
      glyphic subset 23 in that collection could be associated with the
      IVS &lt;82A6 E0134&gt;. This would be reflected in the IVD as
      follows:</p>


         <p xmlns="">IVD_collections.txt would contain one entry for this
      collection:</p>

         <blockquote xmlns="">Example_names;[0-9]+;http://www.example.com/names</blockquote>

         <p xmlns="">IVD_sequences.txt would contain one entry for this
      particular glyphic subset:</p>

         <blockquote xmlns="">82A6 E0134; Example_names; 23</blockquote>

         <p xmlns="">Using these entries, the IVS &lt;82A6, E0134&gt; can be
      traced to entity 23 in the collection
      “Example_names”, and that collection can be traced
      to the web site “http://www.example.com/names”,
      and therefore to the description of the collection and its
      glyphic subsets.</p>
    

    
         <h2 xmlns="">
            <a name="w1aac17c11b1">4 Using the IVS</a>
         </h2>

         <p xmlns="">Now that the IVS is registered, it can be used in plain
      text interchange. The example sentence could be represented by
      the character sequence &lt;82A6, 7530, .., 82A6, E0134,
      ...&gt;. The first occurrence of U+82A6 is not adorned with a
      variation selector, because there is no need to express any
      glyphic restriction. The second occurrence uses the registered
      variation sequence, and can be interpreted unambiguously using
      the IVD.</p>
