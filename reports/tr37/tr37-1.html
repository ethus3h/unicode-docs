    <h2><a name="N10048">1 Introduction</a></h2>

    <p>Characters in the Unicode Standard can be represented by a
    wide variety of glyphs. Occasionally the need arises in text
    processing to restrict or change the set of glyphs that are to be
    used to display a character. In special circumstances, this
    restriction needs to be expressed in plain text rather than by
    font selection or some other rich text mechanism. The Unicode
    Standard accomodates those circumstances with variation selectors:
    the code point of a graphic character can be followed by the code
    point of a variation selector to identify a restriction on the
    graphic character. The combination of a graphic character and a
    variation selector is known as a variation sequence (See
    <i>Section 15.6, Variaton Selectors</i> of
    <i>[<a href="tr37-1.html#biblio_unicode">Unicode</a>]</i>).</p>


    <p>In the case of Han ideographs, it is impossible to build a
    single collection of variation sequences that can satisfy all the
    needs of the users. The requirements from scholars, governments
    and publishers are too different to be accomodated by a single
    collection. Instead they can be met by having multiple independent
    collections. The Ideographic Variation Database ensures that a
    given variation sequence is used in at most one collection, to
    make interchange of text using such variation sequences
    reliable.</p>
  
    <h2><a name="N1005A">2 Description</a></h2>

    <p>The Ideographic Varation Database records registered
    variation sequences made of a base character with the Ideographic
    property and one of the variation selectors in the range U+E0100
    to U+E01EF. Those variations sequences are suitable for use in
    text interchange.</p>

    <p>[Ed Note: will need to modify StandardizedVariants.html to
    include the database by reference.]</p>

    <p>To guarantee the stability of data encoded using registered
    variation sequences, those sequences are never removed or
    reassigned.</p>

    <p>Ideographic Variation Sequences are subject to the usual
    rules for variation sequences: unregistered sequences should not
    be used, and registered sequences should be used according to
    their intent. Furthermore, variation selectors are default
    ignorable. This implies that registrants should carefully consider
    whether a variation sequence, when viewed as a possible set of
    glyphs, is indeed a subset of the glyphs which are acceptable for
    the base character alone.</p>

    <p>The registration process only ensures that once a registrant
    has successfully registered a variation sequence, the specific
    combination of base character and variation selector used to
    represent that sequence in text will not be used to register
    another sequence. However, this does not prevent two distinct
    variation sequences from representing the same visual form or
    variant of a base character.</p>

    <p>There is no guarantee that two sequences involving the same
    variation selector on different base characters have any
    relationship nor will a variation selector be designated,
    independantly of any base, for any purpose. Should there be a
    requirement to register more than 240 sequences involving the same
    base character, the Unicode Consortium will seek the encoding of
    additional variation selectors, and make those available for
    registration of Ideographic Variation Sequences.</p>

    <p>Registration of a collection does not imply suitability for
    any purpose. The usefulness of a given variation sequence, and the
    usefulness of a collection as a whole depends to a large extent on
    their use. Registrants are encouraged to describe the intent of
    their collections, and users are also encouraged to evaluate
    whether a collection is useful for their purpose.</p>

    <p>[Ed note, from Rick: But (a point of interest to some)
    neither the registry nor the registrar guarantees the perpetual
    availability of the registered entities. Thus, it is possible at
    some future time for the definitions pointed to by the registry
    become unavailable for query or use.</p>

    <p>(To me as an end-user, this would be a fatal flaw in the
    usefulness of the registry. I could have documents containing
    these sequences, and yet at some future time, not be guaranteed
    ever to be able to find out what they mean. This contrasts with
    the standard itself, in which one can always find out the contents
    by having a copy of the standard. Somehow, users of this registry
    should be cautioned in this.)]</p>
  
    <h2><a name="N1007B">3 Format of the Ideographic Variation Database</a></h2>

    <p>The Ideographic Variation Database consists of two data
    files. The first, IVD_Collections.txt records the registered
    collections. The second, IVD_Sequences.txt records the registered
    sequences.</p>

    <p>In each file, lines starting with a '#' character and empty
    lines are comment lines. The other lines are organized into
    fields, separated by a semicolon; initial and trailing white space
    in those fields is not significant. Both files are encoded in
    UTF-8, using U+000A as the line separator.</p>

    <p>In IVD_Collections.txt, each line corresponds to an Ideographic
    Variation Collection, and there are two fields per line:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	  field 1: the identifier of a collection
      </li>
      <li>
	field 2: the URL of a site describing the collection
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In IVD_Sequences.txt, each line corresponds to an Ideographic
    Variation Sequence and there are four fields per line:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	field 1: the code points of the base character and the
	the variation selector, separated by a space
      </li>
      <li>
	field 2: the identifier of the collection under which the
	sequence is registered
      </li>
      <li>
	field 3: the identifier of the sequence, provided by the
	registrant
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The identifiers for collections and sequences are character
    strings starting with one of 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', and continuing
    with one of 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '0'..'9', '_'.</p>
  
    <h2><a name="N100B4">4 Registration Procedure</a></h2>

    
      <h3><a name="N100B9">4.1 Registration of a Collection</a></h3>

      <p>The registrant must first create a web page describing the
      intent of the collection, its principles, and any other data
      that may be useful for users of the collection.</p>

      <p>Once the appropriate page is online, the intent to
      register the collection must be announced publicly in a manner
      designated by the registrar. This announcement must include the
      URL of the page(s) describing the proposed collection. This
      starts a review period of at least 90 days, during which
      comments and questions about the collection can be submitted to
      the registrant. The registrant should respond to these comments
      and questions.</p>

      <p>At the end of the review period, the registrant can submit
      the registration form in <a href="tr37-1.html#registration_form">Appendix
      A</a>, together with a written and signed statement that:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  <p>the registrant will make reasonable efforts to
	  maintain the stability of that URL and the site it points
	  to</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>the variation sequences that will be registered in
	  that collection can be used freely, without any limitation,
	  fee or other requirement</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>all the comments and questions received during the
	  review period have been addressed</p>
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Upon receipt of a complete application and the applicable
      fee if any, the registrar will assign a collection identifier
      (respecting as much as possible the suggested identifier), and
      add the collection to the Ideographic Variation Database.</p>

      <p>Owners of collections can change the designated
      representative at any time by notifying the registrar. They can
      also change the URL of the web site they maintain by notifying
      the registrar. Ownership of a collection can be transferred to
      another party by notifying the registrar.</p>

      <p>The registration of sequences in that collection can be
      started concurrently with the registration of the collection
      itself.</p>
    

    
      <h3><a name="N100EA">4.2 Registration of Sequences in a Collection</a></h3>

      <p>The registrant must first include the proposed sequences
      in the web page describing the collection (or some page pointing
      from it). Ideally, this description should include
      representative glyphs for proposed sequences.</p>

      <p>Once the page is online, the intent to register the
      sequences must be announced on a mailing list designated by the
      registrar. This announcement must include the URL of the page(s)
      describing the proposed sequences. This starts a review period
      of 3 months, during which comments and questions about the
      sequences can be submitted to the mailing list.  The registrant
      should respond to these comments and questions.</p>

      <p>At the end of the review period, the registrant can submit
      the application for those sequences. This takes the form of a
      file in the format of IVD_Sequences.txt, except that the first
      field must contain only the code point of the base
      character.</p>

      <p>Upon receipt of a complete application and the applicable
      fee if any, the registrar will assign a variation selector for
      each variation sequence, and add the sequences to the
      Ideographic Variation Database.</p>
    

    
      <h3><a name="N100FC">4.3 Registrar</a></h3>

      <p>[Ed note: registration authority vs. registrar]</p>

      <p>The registrar will be appointed by the Unicode Consortium.</p>
    

    
      <h3><a name="N10108">4.4 Registration Fees</a></h3>

      <p>The registrar may impose a non-refundable processing fee
      for the registration of collections and sequences. If a
      registration application is incomplete, the registrar will
      inform the registrant and accept one corrected application at no
      fee. Further corrections to the application may require an
      additional fee.</p>

      <p>The registrar may wave the processing fee for Full members
      of the Consortium in good standing. This waiver may be limited
      to some number of collections and sequences for each calendar
      year. Full members of the Consortium may sponsor the
      registration of other parties.</p>

      <p>The Unicode Consortium may register collections or
      sequences at any time without any processing fee.</p>
