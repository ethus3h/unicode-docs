<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>1 Introduction</h2>     
<p>UTF-32 defines an encoding form for Unicode for representing Unicode code      
points with single 32-bit code units. With the addition of UTF-32, the Unicode      
Standard now has three sanctioned encoding forms: UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32.      
These use 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit code units, respectively.</p>     
<p>Different encoding forms of Unicode are useful in different system      
environments. For example, UTF-32 is somewhat simpler in usage than UTF-16, but      
in almost all cases occupies twice the storage. A common strategy is to have      
internal string storage use UTF-16 or UTF-8, but to use UTF-32 for individual      
character datatypes.</p>   
<p>Considerations of byte-order serialization lead to a further     
subdivision of this encoding form into 3 encoding schemes: UTF-32 (possibly     
using BOM), UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE.</p>    
<p>The following lists the important features of this encoding form:</p>    
<ul>    
  <li>UTF-32 is restricted in values to the range 0..10FFFF<sub>16</sub>, which     
    precisely matches the range of characters defined in the Unicode Standard     
    (and other standards such as XML), and those representable by UTF-8 and     
    UTF-16.    
  <li>Over and above ISO 10646, the Unicode Standard adds a number of     
    conformance constraints on character semantics (see <i>The Unicode Standard,     
    Version 3.0, Chapter 3).</i> Declaring UTF-32 instead of UCS-4 allows     
    implementations to explicitly commit to Unicode semantics.    
  <li>The term <i>UTF-32</i> is parallel to <i>UTF-16</i> and <i>UTF-8</i>,     
    avoiding confusion among software developers â€” especially since the     
    pronunciations of &quot;UTF&quot; and &quot;UCS&quot; are so very similar.</li>    
</ul>    
<p>The code units for UTF-32 correspond exactly to Unicode code points. Compare     
this to UTF-8, where only for the ASCII repertoire (U+0000..U+007F) do code     
units numerically correspond to code points. In terms of frequency of use, the     
situation for UTF-16 is essentially the same as UTF-32. For the vast majority of     
computer text in the world, UTF-16 code units correspond to code points, since     
the frequency of characters with code points above U+FFFF is and will remain     
vanishingly small.</p>    
<p>In any event, however, Unicode code points do <i>not</i> necessarily match      
user-expectations for &quot;characters&quot;. For example, the following are not    
represented by a single code point: a combining character sequences such as &lt;g, acute&gt;;     
a conjoining jamo sequence; or the Devanagari conjunct &quot;ksha&quot;. These     
are better matched by      
grapheme boundaries, as explained in <a    
href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/uni2book/ch05.pdf">Chapter 5,     
Implementation Guidelines</a> and in <a    
href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr18/">UTR #18: Unicode Regular     
Expression Guidelines</a>.</p>    
<p>For a discussion      
of the general framework for understanding the Unicode character encoding and      
its relationship to the Unicode Transformation Formats, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr17/">UTR #17,

<h2>3 Relation to ISO/IEC <a name="10646">10646</a> and UCS-4</h2>    
<p>ISO/IEC 10646 defines a 4-byte encoding form called <i>UCS-4</i>. Since     
UTF-32 is simply a subset of UCS-4 characters, it is conformant to ISO/IEC 10646     
as well as to the Unicode Standard.    
<p>As of the recent publication of the second edition of ISO/IEC 10646-1, UCS-4     
still assigns private use codepoints (E00000<sub>16</sub>..FFFFFF<sub>16</sub>     
and 60000000<sub>16</sub>..7FFFFFFF<sub>16</sub>) that are not in the range of     
valid Unicode codepoints. To promote interoperability among the Unicode encoding     
forms JTC1/SC2/WG2 has approved a motion removing those private use assignments:</p>    
<blockquote>    
  <p><i>Resolution M38.6 (Restriction of encoding space) [adopted unanimously]</i></p>    
  <p>&quot;WG2 accepts the proposal in document N2175 towards removing the     
  provision for Private Use Groups and Planes beyond Plane 16 in ISO/IEC 10646,     
  to ensure internal consistency in the standard between UCS-4, UTF-8 and UTF-16     
  encoding formats, and instructs its project editor [to] prepare suitable text     
  for processing as a future Technical Corrigendum or an Amendment to     
  10646-1:2000.&quot;</p>    
</blockquote>    
<p>While this resolution must still be approved as an Amendment to 10646-1:2000,    
the Unicode Technical Committee has every expectation that once the text for    
that Amendment completes its formal balloting it will proceed smoothly to    
publication as part of that standard.</p>   
<p>Until the formal balloting is concluded, the term UTF-32 can be used to refer     
to the subset of UCS-4 characters that are in the range of valid Unicode code     
points. After it passes, UTF-32 will then simply be an alias for UCS-4 (with the     
extra requirement that Unicode semantics are observed).</p>
