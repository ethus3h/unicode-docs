  <h2>1. <a name="Scope">Scope</a></h2>
  <p>This report discusses of common aspects of character properties.   
  This description of the Unicode character property model is not intended to  
  supersede the normative information on  properties in The Unicode  
  Standard [<a href="tr23-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>],  nor the existing body  
  of technical reports and documentation files in the Unicode Character  
  Database that provide detailed descriptions for   
  particular character properties. Instead it presents a general overview and   
  typology of character properties and property values.</p>  
  <p>In some ways, the model of character 
  properties presented here goes beyond the current text of the standard, 
	because 
  it lays the foundation for a future clarification of the definition of 
  character properties in later updates to the Unicode standard.</p> 
  <p>This report specifically covers formal <b>character properties</b>, which                                          
  are those attributes of characters specified according to the                                          
  definitions set forth in this report.&nbsp;</p>                                         
  <h2><a name="Overview">2. Overview</a></h2>                                         
  <p>At its most basic, a character  
  property relates a character to a value. At its most  
  general, a property can be considered a function that maps from code points to 
	specific  
  property values.</p>                               
  <h3><a name="Origin">2.1 Origin of Character Properties</a></h3>
  <p>The Unicode Standard views character semantics as inherent to the                                          
  definition of a character, and conformant processes are required to take these                                          
  into account when interpreting characters.&nbsp;</p>                                         
  <blockquote class="tus">
    <p><i>D3 Character semantics:</i> The semantics of a character are                                          
    determined by its identity, normative properties, and behavior.</p>                                    
  </blockquote>
  <p>The assignment of character semantics in the Unicode Standard is based on                                          
  character behavior. Other character set standards leave it to the                                          
  implementer, or to unrelated secondary standards, to assign character                                          
  semantics to characters. In contrast, the Unicode Standard supplies a                                          
  rich set of character attributes, called properties, for each character                                          
  contained in it. Many properties are specified in relation to                                          
  processes or algorithms that interpret them, in order to implement the                                          
  character behavior.</p>                                         
  <h3><a name="Context">2.2 Character Behavior in Context</a></h3>
  <p>The interpretation of some properties (such as whether a character is a 
  digit or not) is  
  largely independent of context, whereas the interpretation of others (such as  
  directionality) is applicable to a character sequence as a whole, rather than  
  to the individual characters that compose the sequence.</p> 
  <p>Other examples that require context include title casing, and the classification of neutrals  
  in script assignments. The line breaking rules 
  of <i><a href="../tr14/index.html">UAX#14  
  Line Breaking Properties</a> </i>[<a href="tr23-7.html#LineBreak">LineBreak</a>]  
  involve character pairs and triples, and in certain cases, longer sequences.  
  The glyph(s) defined by a combining character sequence are the result of  
  contextual analysis in the display shaping engine. Isolated character  
  properties typically only tell part of the story.</p> 
  <p>In some cases, the expected character behavior depends on external context,  
  such as the type and nature of the document, the language of the text, or the  
  cultural expectations of the user. Properties modeling such behaviors  
  may be specified in separate standards, as is the case for   
  the <i><a href="../tr10/index.html">UTS#10 Unicode Collation Algorithm</a></i>  
  [<a href="tr23-7.html#UCA">UCA</a>]. Where a reasonably generic set of property values   
  can be assigned, for example for [<a href="tr23-7.html#LineBreak">LineBreak</a>], such properties may  
  be defined as part of [<a href="tr23-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]. 
	Such properties and any algorithms related to them define useful default 
	behavior, which can be further customized or tailored to meet more specific 
	requirements.</p>  
  <h3><a name="Relation">2.3 Relation of Character Properties to Algorithms</a></h3>
  <p>When modeling character behavior with computer processes, formal character 
  properties are assigned to achieve the expected results. Such 
  modeling depends heavily on the algorithms used to produce these results. In some cases, a given character 
  property is specified in close conjunction with a detailed specification of an 
  algorithm. In other cases, algorithms are implied but not specified, or there 
  are several algorithms that can make use of the same general character property. 
  The last case may require occasional implementation-specific adjustments in character property 
  assignment to make all algorithms work correctly. This can usually be achieved 
  by overriding specific properties for specific algorithms. (See also
	<a href="tr23-7.html#Higher">Section 4.3</a> &quot;Overriding Properties via Higher-level 
	Protocols&quot;)</p>
  <p>When assigning character properties for use with a given algorithm, it may                                          
  be tempting to assign somewhat arbitrary values to some characters, as long as                                          
  the algorithm happens to produce the expected results.Proceeding in                                          
  this way hides the nature of the character and limits the re-use of character                                          
  properties by related processes. Therefore, instead of tweaking the properties                                          
  to simply make a particular algorithm easier, the Unicode Standard pays                                          
  careful attention to the essential underlying linguistic identity of the                                          
  character. However, not all aspects of a character&#x2019;s identity are relevant in                                          
  all circumstances, and some characters can be used in many different ways,                                          
  depending on context or circumstance. This means the formal character                                          
  properties alone are not sufficient to describe the complete range of                                          
  desirable or acceptable character behaviors.</p>                                         
  <blockquote>
  <p><b>Note:</b> In some cases, the relevant algorithm is not defined in the 
  Unicode standard. For example, the algorithm that converts strings of digits into 
  numerical values is not defined in the Unicode Standard, but 
  implementations will nevertheless refer to the numeric_value property.</p>                          
  </blockquote>
  <h3><a name="CodePointProperties">2.4 Code Point And Abstract Character Properties</a></h3>
	<p>Code point properties are properties of code points per se: in 
	a character encoding standard these are independent of any assignment of actual 
	abstract characters to those code points. In most character encoding standards, these are 
	trivial, but in the Unicode Standard they are not. </p>
	<p>Examples of code point properties include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Code point XXX is a surrogate code point. </li>
		<li>Code point XXX is a private 
	use code point. </li>
		<li>Code point XXX is a reserved code point. </li>
		<li>Code point XXX is 
	reserved for 
	encoding format control characters. </li>
		<li>Code point XXX is earmarked for encoding a RTL script. </li>
		<li>Code 
	point XXX is a Pattern_Syntax code point. </li>
		<li>Code point XXX is a Pattern_Whitespace code point. 
		</li>
		<li>Code point XXX is located on Plane 1. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>These things remain true of a code point whether or not there is a 
	particular abstract character assigned to them, or they track status of code points as to 
	whether any abstract character is assigned to them or can be assigned to them, and so on. 
	Essentially, whenever code points are designated or ranges are reserved in 
	some way, by constraining what they can contain in the future, 
	code point properties are assigned.</p>
	<p>Character properties are those properties that abstract 
	characters have independent of any consideration of their encoding. </p>
	<p>Examples of character properties include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>G is an alphabetic character. </li>
		<li>G is in the Latin script. G is an 
	uppercase letter. </li>
		<li>G is not used in hexadecimal expressions. </li>
		<li>G collates after F in the English 
	alphabet. </li>
		<li>G was putatively invented by Spurius Carvilus Ruga ca. 300. </li>
		<li>G commonly represents the 
	velar voiced stop in orthographies. </li>
		<li>G is not a punctuation character. </li>
		<li>G denotes giga in the SI 
	system of nomenclature. </li>
		<li>G has no diacritic. </li>
		<li>G is a base character. </li>
		<li>G is not a combining 
	character. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>By virtue of encoding the abstract character LATIN CAPITAL LETTER G 
	at the code point U+0047, this universe of character properties, some known 
	and obvious, others obscure or even undiscovered, are associated with that code point. </p>
	<p>Some of those character properties aregeneric and systematic 
	enough to be useful or even necessary in the implementation of general text processing algorithms 
	— those are the ones that the Unicode Standard formalizes as properties in the 
	Unicode Character Database. </p>
	<p>General text processing algorithms and the 
	programming APIs through which they are accessed, must be prepared to deal 
	with any code point, even one that is unassigned to any characters at the 
	time the implementation was created. As a result, they nearly always need to 
	properly handle each and every code point for any character property, even if they 
	only associate a property value of &#39;unknown&#39; or &#39;inapplicable&#39; to unassigned 
	or unsupported code points.</p>
	<p>This requirement leads to the use of the unifying concept 
	of Encoded Character Property in the Unicode character property model. An 
	encoded character property combines the concept of a code point property 
	associating ranges of code points with default values of a property, with 
	the concept of a character property associating specific values to the 
	assigned characters. This unified model correlates well with the reality of 
	Unicode-based implementations, which must supply some value for each and 
	every code point. In addition, this unified concept simplifies most of the 
	definitions that are built on top of it, since it is no longer necessary to 
	separately account for definitions applying to character properties vs. code 
	point properties.</p>
	<h3><a name="Normative">2.5 Normative Properties</a></h3>
  <p>As specified in Chapter 3, <i>Conformance</i>, The Unicode Standard [<a href="tr23-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] 
  defines both normative and informative properties.</p>
  <blockquote class="tus">
			
			<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>D33 Normative property: </i>
			A Unicode character property 
			used in the specification of the standard.</p>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Specification that a character property is normative 
	means that implementations which claim conformance to a particular version 
	of the Unicode Standard and which make use of that particular property must 
	follow the specifications of the standard for that property for the 
	implementation to be conformant. For example, the directionality property 
	(bidirectional character type) is required for conformance whenever 
	rendering text that requires bidirectional layout, such as Arabic or Hebrew. </p>
			<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whenever a normative process depends on a 
			property in a specified way, that property is designated as 
			normative. </p>
			<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that a given Unicode character property 
			is normative does not mean that the values of the property will 
			never change for particular characters. Corrections and extensions 
			to the standard in the future may require minor changes to normative 
			values, even though the Unicode Technical Committee strives to 
			minimize such changes...</p>
			<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the normative Unicode algorithms depend 
			critically on particular property values for their behavior. 
			Normalization, for example, defines an aspect of textual 
			interoperability that many applications rely on to be absolutely 
			stable. As a result, some of the normative properties disallow any 
			kind of overriding by higher-level protocols. Thus the 
			decomposition of Unicode characters is both normative and <i>not 
			overridable</i>; no higher-level protocol may override these values, 
			because to do so would result in non-interoperable results for the 
			normalization of Unicode text. Other normative properties, such as 
			case mapping, are <i>overridable</i> by higher-level protocols, 
			because their intent is to provide a common basis for behavior. 
			Nevertheless, they may require tailoring for particular local cultural conventions 
			or particular implementations.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>By making a property normative and non-overridable, the Unicode Standard guarantees that                                          
  conformant implementations can rely on other conformant                                          
  implementations to interpret the character in the same way. This is most                                          
  useful for those properties where the Unicode Standard provides precise rules                                          
  for the interpretation&nbsp;of characters based on their properties, such as the decompositions and their use by the Normalization forms [<a href="tr23-7.html#Normal">Normal</a>].</p>                                        
  <blockquote>

  </blockquote>
  <p>For some character properties, such as the general category, the Unicode 
	standard does not define what model of processing the property is intended to                   
  support, nor does it specify the required consequences of a character being 
	defined as                   
  &quot;Letter Other&quot; as opposed to &quot;Symbol Other&quot;, for example. In the                   
  absence of such definition, the only effect of conformance that can be 
	rigorously tested                   
  is whether a conformant implementation of a character property 
	function returns the correct                   
  value to its caller. However, many implementations use such normative 
	properties for their own purposes and guaranteed access to this information 
	helps interoperability.</p>

  <p>Properties may be informative for two main reasons:</p>

    <li>The nature of the property may be unclear. In some cases, the precise set of characters to which it

  <h3>2.7 <a name="Referring"> Referring to Properties</a></h3> 
  <p>The Property Aliases [<a href="tr23-7.html#Alias">Alias</a>] and Property Value 
  Aliases [<a href="tr23-7.html#ValueAlias">ValueAlias</a>] define        
  a set of names and abbreviations, called aliases, that are used to refer to properties and        
  property values. These names can be used for XML formats of data in 
  the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/ucd/">Unicode        
  Character Database</a> [<a href="tr23-7.html#UCD">UCD</a>], for regular-expression        
  property tests, and other programmatic textual descriptions of Unicode data.        
  The names themselves are not normative, except where they correspond to        
  normative properties in the UCD. However, other standards may make normative 
	references to both normative and informative aliases. For more information, see
	<a href="../tr18.1">UTS 
    #18: <i>Unicode Regular Expressions</i></a> [<a href="tr23-7.html#RegEx">RegEx</a>].</p>
	<p>There is one abbreviated name and one long 
    name for most of the properties.Additional aliases may be added at 
	any time. The property value names are <i>not</i> unique across properties. For 
    example, <b>AL</b> means Arabic Letter for the Bidi_Class property, and <b>AL</b> 
    means Alpha_Left for the Combining_Class property, and <b>AL</b> means 
    Alphabetic for the Line_Break property. In addition, some property names may 
    be the same as some property value names. For example, <b>cc</b> means 
    Combining_Class property, and <b>cc</b> means the General_Category property 
    value Control. The combination of property value and property name is, 
    however, unique. </p>
	<p>The aliases may be translated in appropriate environments, and additional        
  aliases may be used. The case distinctions, whitespace, and '_' in the        
  property names are not normative. Unless a specific form is required in a        
  particular application, all forms are equivalent.</p>

  number of files containing property data along with a documentation file explaining the organization of the database and the format and meaning of the

<p>While the Unicode Consortium strives to minimize  
changes to character property data, occasionally the character properties for 
already encoded characters must be  
updated. When this situation occurs, the relevant data files of the Unicode  
Character Database are revised. The revised data files are posted on the Unicode

  <p>This technical report does not define conformance requirements, but the  
  following subsections discuss and summarize the conformance requirements  
  related to character properties stated in the Unicode Standard.</p> 
  <h3><a name="Requirements">4.1 Conformance Requirements</a></h3>
  <p>In Chapter 3, Conformance, The Unicode Standard [Unicode] states<i> </i>that<i>                              
  &quot;A process shall interpret a coded character representation according to 
  the character</i> <i>semantics established by this standard, if that process                              
  does interpret that coded character</i> <i>representation.&quot; </i>The                              
  semantics of a character are established by taking its coded representation,                              
  character name and representative glyph in context and are further defined by                              
  its normative properties and behavior. Neither character name nor                              
  representative glyphs can be relied upon absolutely; a character may have a                              
  broader range of use than the most literal interpretation of its character                              
  name, and the representative glyph is only indicative of one of a range of                              
  typical glyphs representing the same character.</p>                             
  <h3>4.2 <a name="Algorithms">Algorithms</a> and Character Properties</h3>
	<p>Unicode algorithms are specified 
	as an idealized series of steps (rules) performed on an input of character 
	codes and their associated properties. [<a href="tr23-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] states:</p>
	<blockquote class="tus">
		<ul>
			<li>An implementation claiming conformance to a Unicode algorithm 
			need only guarantee
			that it produces the same results as those specified in the logical 
			description of
			the process; it is not required to follow the actual described 
			procedure in detail. This
			allows room for alternative strategies and optimizations in 
			implementation.</li>
		</ul>
	</blockquote>
	<p>As long as the same results are 
	achieved, the implementation is also not required to use the actual 
	properties published in the [<a href="tr23-7.html#UCD">UCD</a>].
	<i>Overriding</i> 
	a property value therefore does not necessarily imply an actual change in 
	property assignments, merely that the conformant implementation of an 
	algorithm now produces the same results as if the property values had been 
	changed in the description of the ideal algorithm.</p>
  <h3><a name="Overriding">4.3 Overriding Properties</a><a name="Higher"> via 
	Higher-level Protocols</a></h3>
  <p>In discussing 
	character semantics, the Unicode Standard [<a href="tr23-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] 
	makes this statement about overriding   
  properties and character behavior:</p>
    <blockquote class="tus">
  <p>Some normative behavior is default behavior; this behavior can be 
  overridden by higher-level protocols. However, in the absence of such 
  protocols, the behavior must be observed so as to follow the character 
  semantics.</p>
  </blockquote>
	<p>Overrides by a higher-level 
	protocol can conceptually take many forms, including, but not limited to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>providing artificial context for an algorithm 
		that defines a 
		context-dependent string function</li>
	<li>applying the algorithm on a substring</li>
		<li>emulating the effect of 
		format control characters in markup</li>
		<li>reassigning a different 
		property value to a character during processing or rendering</li>
		<li>changing the result of a 
		string function for particular inputs</li>
</ul>
	<p>Where overrides involve normative 
	properties, specific restrictions apply, for example:</p>
	<blockquote class="tus">
		<p>• The character combination properties and the canonical ordering 
  behavior cannot be overridden by higher-level protocols.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>For additional examples see section 4.3 in
	<a href="../tr9/index.html">
	UAX #9: <i>The Bidirectional 
  Algorithm</i></a> [<a href="tr23-7.html#Bidi">Bidi</a>]. 
	There are some normative properties that are fully overridable, for example 
	General Category.</p>
	<p>On the other hand, any and all informative properties may be overridden. 
	However, if doing so changes the result of a Unicode Algorithm, any 
	implementation wishing to conform to that algorithm 
	must indicate that overrides have been applied.</p>
	<h2>5. <a name="Maintenance">Updating Properties and Extending the Standard</a>&nbsp;</h2>                            
  <h3><a name="Updating">5.1 Updating Properties</a></h3>                            
  <p>Updates to properties the Unicode Character Database can be required for three reasons:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>To cover new characters added to the Unicode Standard</li>
    <li>To add new properties</li>
    <li>To change the assigned values for a property for some characters</li>
  </ol>
  While the Unicode Consortium endeavors to keep the values of all character                           
      properties as stable as possible, some circumstances may arise that                           
      require changing them. Changing a character&#39;s property assignment may 
	impact existing                           
  implementations and is therefore done judiciously and with                           
  great care, only when there is no better alternative.                          
      <p>In particular, as Unicode encodes less well-documented scripts, such as 
		those for minority languages, the exact  
      character properties and behavior may not be known when the script  
      is first encoded. The properties for such characters are 
		expected to be changed as information becomes available.
      <p>As 
		implementation experience grows, it may become necessary to readjust property values. As much as possible, such readjustments are compatible 
		with established practice. Occasionally, a character property is 
		changed to prevent incorrect generalizations of a character&#39;s use based on its nominal property values. For example, U+200B 
		<span class="name">ZERO 
		WIDTH SPACE</span> was originally classified as a space character (General 
		Category=Zs), but is now classified as a Formal Control (gc=Cf) to 
		distinguish this line break control from space characters.<p>In other cases, there may have been unintentional mistakes in the 
      original information that require corrections.
	<p>The [<a href="tr23-7.html#UTC">UTC</a>] 
	carefully weighs the costs of a change against the benefit of the correction. In 
	addition, all updates to properties 
      are subject to the stability guarantees described in the next section.<br>
  <h3><a name="Guarantees">5.2 Stability Guarantees</a></h3>
  <p class="mainItem">Unicode guarantees the stability of character assignments; 
  that is, the <i>identity</i> of a character encoded at a given location will 
  remain the same. Once<b> </b>a character is encoded, its properties may still 
  be changed, but <i>not</i>  in such a way as to change  
      the fundamental identity of the character.</p> 
  <p> For example, the representative glyph for                      
      U+0061 &quot;A&quot; could not be changed to &quot;B&quot;; the general                      
      category for U+0061 &quot;A&quot; could not be changed to Ll <i>(lowercase                      
      letter);</i> and the decomposition mapping for U+00C1 (Á) could not be                      
      changed to &lt;U+0042, U+0301&gt; (B, ´).</p>                     
  <p>In addition, for some properties, one or more of the following aspects are 
	guaranteed to be invariant:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;stability of assignment&nbsp;</li>                            
    <li>&nbsp;stability of result when applying the property</li>                           
    <li>&nbsp;stability of set of values for a property</li>                            
    <li>&nbsp;stability of relation to another property</li>                            
    <li>&nbsp;stability of file formats</li>                            
  </ul>
  <p>For the most up-to-date   
  specification of all stability guarantees in effect see the <i> Unicode Stability   
  Policy</i> [<a href="tr23-7.html#Stability">Stability</a>]. Note that the status of a property
  as normative does not imply a stability guarantee.</p> 
  <h4>5.2.1 Stability of Assignment</h4> 
  <p>Stability of assignment is the characteristic of an <i>immutable</i> property. For 
  example, once a character is encoded, its code point and name are   
      immutable properties. An immutable properties 
  allows software and documents to refer to its values without needing to track 
  future updates to the Standard. One side effect of an immutable property is 
  that errors in property values cannot be fixed. For example, mistakes in naming are 
	annotated in the 
	Unicode character names list in a note or by using an   
      alias, but the formal name remains unchanged, even in cases of clear-cut 
  typographical errors.</p> 
  <p>Because Code_Point is an immutable property, if a character is ever 
  found to be unnecessary, or a mistaken duplicate of an existing 
  character, it will not be removed. Instead, it can be given an additional 
  property, <i>deprecated</i>, and its use strongly discouraged. 
  However, the interpretation of all existing documents containing 
  the character remains the same.</p> 
<h4>5.2.2 Stability of Result when Applying the Property</h4> 
      <p>Stability of result is the characteristic of a <i>stable</i> property. For 
      example, once a character is encoded, its canonical combining class and  
      decomposition (canonical or compatibility) are stable with respect to  
      normalization. Stability with respect to normalization is defined in such 
      a way that if a string contains only characters from a given version of the  
      Unicode Standard (say Unicode 3.2), and it is put into a normalized form  
      in accordance with that version of Unicode, then it will be in normalized  
      form when normalized according to any future version of Unicode.</p> 
  <p>However, unlike character code and 
	character name, some properties that are guaranteed to be stable may be corrected in 
  <i>   
  exceptional</i> circumstances that are clearly defined by the Unicode 
  Stability Policy [<a href="tr23-7.html#Stability">Stability</a>]. In addition to other 
	requirements, the correction must be of an obvious mistake, such as a 
	typographical error, and any alternative would violate the stability of the 
	identity of the character in question. The obviates the need for    
  encoding duplicate characters simply to correct clerical or other clear-cut    
  errors in property assignments.</p>   
<h4>5.2.3 Stability of Set of Values for a Property</h4>  
  For most properties, additional property values may be created and assigned to                          
  both new and existing characters. For example additional line breaking classes                          
  will be assigned if characters are discovered to require line breaking                          
  behavior that cannot be expressed with the existing set of classes. For other                          
  properties the set of values is guaranteed to be fixed, or their range is                          
  limited. For example, the set of values for the General Category or                          
  Bidirectional Class is fixed, while Combining classes are limited to the values 0 to 255.                          
<h4>5.2.4 Stability of Relation to Another Property</h4> 
  In many cases, once a character has a certain value for one property, it is                          
  likely to have a particular value for a given other property. These relations                          
  are used by the Unicode Consortium in assigning properties to new characters,                          
  and in evaluating properties for internal consistency. In some cases, such                          
  dependencies are explicitly guaranteed and stable.                         
  <p>For example, all characters other than those of General Category M* have the  
          combining class 0.</p> 
<h4>5.2.5 Stability of File Formats</h4> 
  <p>In principle, the way the property information is presented in the Unicode 
  Character Database is independent of the way this information is defined. 
  However, as the Unicode Standard gets updated, it becomes easier for 
  implementations to track updates if file formats remain unchanged and other 
  aspects of the way the data are organized can remain stable. For the majority 
  of properties, such stability is an informal goal of the development process, 
  but in a few cases, some aspects of the data organization are covered by 
  formal stability guarantees.</p>
  <p>For example, Canonical and Compatibility mappings are always in canonical order,  
          and the resulting recursive decomposition will also be in canonical  
          order. Canonical mappings are also always limited either to a single value or to  
          a pair. The second character in the pair cannot itself have a  
          canonical mapping.</p> 
  <h3><a name="Consistency">5.3 Consistency of Properties</a></h3> 
  <p> In an ideal world, all character properties would be                         
  perfectly self-consistent, and related properties would be consistent with                         
  each other over the entire range of code points. However, The Unicode Standard                         
  is the product of many compromises. It has to strike a balance between                         
  uniformity of treatment for similar characters, and compatibility with existing                         
  practice for characters inherited from legacy encodings. Because of this                         
  balancing act, one can expect a certain number of anomalies in character                         
  properties.</p>
  <p>Sometimes it may be advantageous for an implementation to                          
  purposefully override some of the anomalous property values, increasing the                          
  efficiency and uniformity of algorithms—as long as the results they                          
  produce do not conflict with those specified by the normative properties of                          
  this standard. See Chapter 4, <i>Character Properties</i> in [<a href="tr23-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] for some                          
  examples.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Property values assigned to new                         
  characters added to the Unicode Standard are generally defined so that related                         
  characters are given consistent values, unless deliberate exceptions are                         
  needed. For some properties, definite links between that property and                         
  one or more other properties are defined. For example, for the LineBreak                         
  property, many line break classes are defined in relation to General Category                         
  values.</p>
  <h3><a name="Provisional">5.4 
  Provisional Properties</a></h3>
  <p> 
  Some of the information provided about characters in the Unicode Character 
  Database constitutes provisional data. Provisional property data may capture 
  partial or preliminary information. Such data may contain errors or omissions, 
  or otherwise not be ready for systematic use; however, provisional property 
  data are included in the data files for distribution partly to encourage 
  review and improvement of the information. For example, a number of the tags 
  in the Unihan database provide provisional property values of various sorts 
  about Han characters.</p> 
  <h3><a name="Unmaintained">5.5 Stabilized Properties</a></h3>
  <p> Occasionally, as the    
  standard matures, and new characters, properties or algorithms are defined, the    
  information presented in an existing property may be better represented via other    
  properties, or it may no longer make sense to extend the property to new characters.    
  Such a property may then no longer be maintained in future versions of the    
  Unicode Standard. In that case, it will be designated as <i>stabilized</i>. For    
  backwards compatibility, a stabilized property will remain part of the Unicode    
  Character database, but will not be updated or corrected.</p>   
  <p>An example of a stabilized property is Hyphen.</p>
  <h2><a name="SpecialValues">6. Special Property Values</a></h2>
  <h3><a name="NA">6.1 Not Applicable Value</a></h3>
  <p>Limited properties apply to only a subset of characters. Where these 
  properties are implemented as a partition of the Unicode code space, the characters to which the property does not apply are given a special value denoting that 
  the property does not apply. The &quot;not applicable&quot; value may be the explicit 
	value &quot;N/A&quot; or, for some properties, take other values such as &quot;XX&quot;.</p>
  <h3><a name="Default">6.2 Default Values</a></h3>
  <p>Implementations often need specific properties for <i>all</i> code points, 
  including those that are unassigned. To meet this need, the Unicode standard 
  assigns default properties to ranges of unassigned code points.</p>
  <p>All implementations of the Unicode Standard should endeavor to handle 
  additions to the character repertoire gracefully. In some cases this may 
  require that an implementation attempts to 'anticipate' likely property values 
  for code points for which characters have not yet been defined, but where 
  surrounding characters exist that make it probable that similar characters 
  will be assigned to the code point in question.</p>
  <p>There are three strategies:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Rely on the recommendation from the Unicode Consortium. For example, for 
      the Bidirectional Class, the Unicode Consortium has published recommended 
      default values for all code points.</li>
    <li>Treat the unassigned areas of a given character block as if they had 
      property values common to other characters of the block. A variation of 
      this scheme bridges small gaps in the allocation inside a block by using 
      the property values for the characters bracketing the hole.</li>
    <li>Give an unassigned <i>code point </i>an implementation defined default property 
      that will result in graceful if not completely correct behavior, if 
      an encoded characters is later assigned at that code point.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Each of these strategies has advantages and drawbacks, and none can  
  guarantee that the behavior of an implementation that is conformant to a prior  
  version of the Unicode Standard will support characters added in a later  
  version of the Unicode Standard in precisely the same way as an implementation  
  that is conformant to the later version. The most that can be hoped for, is  
  that the earlier implementation will behave more gracefully in such circumstances.</p> 
  <p>In principle, default values are temporary: they are superseded by final assignments 
  once characters are assigned to a given code point.</p>
  <p>For noncharacter code points, a character property function would return the same 
  value as the default value for unassigned characters.</p>
  <h3><a name="Preliminary">6.3 Preliminary Property Assignments</a></h3> 
  <p>Sometimes, a determination and assignment of property values can be made,  
  but the information on which it was based may be incomplete or preliminary. In  
  such cases, the property value may be changed when better information becomes  
  available. Currently, there is no machine readable way to provide information  
  about the confidence of a property assignment; however, the text of the  
  Standard or a Technical Report defining the property may provide general  
  indications of preliminary status of property assignments where they are  
  known.</p>
  <p>This is distinct from <a href="tr23-7.html#ProvisionalProperty">provisional properties</a>, 
  where the entire property is preliminary.</p>
