  <h2>1. <a name="Scope">Scope</a></h2>
  <p>This report provides discussion of common aspects of character properties.   
  This description of the Unicode character property model is not intended to  
  supersede the normative information on  properties in The Unicode  
  Standard [<a href="tr23-4.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>],  nor the existing body  
  of technical reports and documentation files in the Unicode Character  
  Database that provide detailed descriptions for   
  particular character properties. Instead it presents a general overview and   
  typology of character properties and property values.</p>  
  <p><span style="background-color: #F0F0FF">In some ways, the model of character 
  properties presented here goes beyond the current text of the standard, since 
  it lays the foundation for a future clarification of the definition of 
  character properties in later updates to the Unicode standard.</span></p> 
  <p>This report specifically covers formal <b>character properties</b>, which                                          
  are those attributes of characters that are specified according to the                                          
  definitions set forth in this report.&nbsp;</p>                                         
  <h2><a name="Overview">2. Overview</a></h2>                                         
  <p><span style="background-color: #F0F0FF">At its most basic a character  
  property relates a character (sometimes a code point) to a value. At its most  
  general, a character property can be considered a function;   
  it is a mapping from characters or a character (or code-point) string to a  
  property value.</span></p>                               
  <h3><a name="Origin">2.1 Origin of Character Properties</a></h3>
  <p>The Unicode Standard views character semantics as inherent to the                                          
  definition of a character, and conformant processes are required to take these                                          
  into account when interpreting characters.&nbsp;</p>                                         
  <blockquote class="tus">
    <p><i>D2b Character semantics:</i> The semantics of a character are                                          
    determined by its identity, normative properties, and behavior.</p>                                    
  </blockquote>
  <p>The assignment of character semantics for the Unicode Standard is based on                                          
  character behavior. For other character set standards, it is left to the                                          
  implementer, or to unrelated secondary standards, to assign character                                          
  semantics to characters. In contrast, the Unicode&nbsp; Standard supplies a                                          
  rich set of character attributes, called properties, for each character                                          
  contained in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many properties are specified in relation to                                          
  processes or algorithms that interpret them, in order to implement the                                          
  discovered character behavior.</p>                                         
  <h3><a name="Context">2.2 Character Behavior in Context</a></h3>
  <p>The interpretation of some properties (such as whether a character is a 
  digit or not) is  
  largely independent of context, whereas the interpretation of others (such as  
  directionality) is applicable to a character sequence as a whole, rather than  
  to the individual characters that compose the sequence.</p> 
  <p>Other examples that require context include title casing, and the classification of neutrals  
  in script assignments. The line breaking rules 
  of <i><a href="../tr14/index.html">UAX#14  
  Line Breaking Properties</a> </i>[<a href="tr23-4.html#LineBreak">LineBreak</a>]  
  involve character pairs and triples, and in certain cases, longer sequences.  
  The glyph(s) defined by a combining character sequence are the result of  
  contextual analysis in the display shaping engine. Isolated character  
  properties typically only tell part of the story.</p> 
  <p>In some cases the<span style="background-color: #F0F0FF"> expected </span>character behavior depends on external context,  
  such as the type and nature of the document, the language of the text, or the  
  cultural expectation of the user. Properties modeling such behaviors  
  may be specified in separate standards, as is the case for   
  the <i><a href="../tr10/index.html">UTS#10 Unicode Collation Algorithm</a></i>  
  [<a href="tr23-4.html#UCA">UCA</a>]. Where a reasonably generic set of property values   
  can be assigned, for example for [<a href="tr23-4.html#LineBreak">LineBreak</a>], such properties may  
  be defined as part of [<a href="tr23-4.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] typically as informative and overridable properties.</p>  
  <h3><a name="Relation">2.3 Relation of Character Properties to Algorithms</a></h3>
  <p>When modeling character behavior with computer processes, formal character 
  properties are assigned in order to achieve the expected results. Such 
  modeling depends heavily on algorithms. In some cases, a given character 
  property is specified in close conjunction with a detailed specification of an 
  algorithm. In other cases, algorithms are implied but not specified, or there 
  are several algorithms that can make use of the same general character property. 
  The last case may require occasional implementation-specific adjustments in character property 
  assignment to make all algorithms work correctly. This can usually be achieved 
  by overriding specific properties for specific algorithms. (See also
	<a href="tr23-4.html#Higher">Section 4.3</a> &quot;Overriding Properties via Higher-level 
	Protocols&quot;)</p>
  <p>When assigning character properties for use with a given algorithm, it may                                          
  be tempting to assign somewhat arbitrary values to some characters, as long as                                          
  the algorithm happens to produce the expected results.&nbsp; Proceeding in                                          
  this way hides the nature of the character and limits the re-use of character                                          
  properties by related processes. Therefore, instead of tweaking the properties                                          
  to simply make a particular algorithm easier, the Unicode Standard pays                                          
  careful attention to the underlying essential linguistic identity of the                                          
  character. However, not all aspects of a characters identity are relevant in                                          
  all circumstances, and some characters can be used in many different ways,                                          
  depending on context or circumstance. Because of this the formal character                                          
  properties alone are not sufficient to describe the complete range of                                          
  desirable or acceptable character behaviors.</p>                                         
  <blockquote>
  <p><b>Note:</b> in some cases the relevant algorithm is not defined in the 
  Unicode standard, for example the algorithm that turns strings of digits into 
  numerical values as such is not defined in the Unicode Standard, but 
  implementations will nevertheless refer to the numeric_value property.</p>                          
  </blockquote>
  <h3><a name="Normative">2.4 Normative Properties</a></h3>
  <p>As specified in Chapter 3, <i>Conformance</i>, The Unicode Standard [<a href="tr23-4.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] 
  defines both normative and informative properties.</p>
  <blockquote class="tus">
    <p><i>D9 Normative property:</i> A Unicode character property whose values 
    are required for conformance to the standard.</p>
    <p><i>Normative</i> means that implementations which claim conformance to a 
	particular version of the Unicode Standard and which make use of a 
	particular property must follow the specifications of the standard for that 
	property for the implementation to be conformant. The term <i>normative </i>when applied to a character  
    property does <i>not</i> mean that the value of the property will never  
    change for particular characters. Corrections and extensions to the standard  
    in the future may require minor changes to normative values, even though the  
    Unicode Technical Committee strives to minimize such changes.  
    </p>
	<p>Some of the normative Unicode algorithms depend critically on particular  
    property values for their behavior. As a result, <i>some</i> of the  
    normative properties disallow any kind of overriding by higher-level  
    protocols. Other normative properties are <i>overridable</i> by higher-level  
    protocols, because their intent is to provide a common basis for behavior,  
    but they may require tailoring for particular local cultural conventions or  
    particular implementations. [slightly condensed and examples omitted]</p> 
  </blockquote>
  <p>By making a property normative <span style="background-color: #F0F0FF">and non-overridable</span>, the Unicode Standard guarantees that                                          
  conformant implementations can rely on the fact that other conformant                                          
  implementations will interpret the character in the same way. This is most                                          
  useful for those properties where the Unicode Standard provides precise rules                                          
  for the interpretation&nbsp;of characters based on their properties. Examples                                          
  are the decompositions and their use by the Normalization forms [<a href="tr23-4.html#Normal">Normal</a>].</p>                                        
  <p>For some character properties, for example the general category, the                   
  Unicode standard does not define what model of processing it is intended to                   
  support and what the required consequences are of a character being e.g.                   
  &quot;Letter Other&quot; as opposed to &quot;Symbol Other&quot;. In the                   
  absence of such definition, the only effect of conformance that can be tested                   
  in a strict manner is whether a character property library returns the correct                   
  value to its caller.</p>                  
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Note</b>: One trivial, but important instance of conformant  
    implementation is runtime access to a character property database. For  
    normative properties, conformant implementations guarantee that the returned  
    values match the values defined by the Unicode Consortium.</p>

  normative, see the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeCharacterDatabase.html">documentation

	<a href="tr23-4.html#Higher">Section 4.3</a> <i>Overriding Properties via Higher-level Protocols</i>.</p>           
  <h3><a name="Informative">2.5 Informative Properties</a></h3>           
  <blockquote class="tus">
    <p><i>D9a Informative property:</i> A Unicode character property whose 
    values are provided for information only.</p>
    <p>A conformant implementation is free to use or change such values as it    
    may require, while remaining conformant to the standard. Particular    
    implementations may choose to <i> override</i> the properties that are not    
    normative. In that case, the implementer has the option of establishing a    
    protocol to convey that particular    
    properties are being used in distinct ways. When an informative property is    
    explicitly specified in the Unicode Character Database, its use is strongly <i>   
    recommended</i> for implementations to encourage comparable behavior between    
    implementations. Note that it is possible for an informative property in one    
    version of the Unicode Standard to become a normative property in a    
    subsequent version of the standard if its use starts to acquire conformance 
    implications in some part of the standard. [emphasis added].</p>   
  </blockquote>
  <p>Properties may be informative for two main reasons.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The nature of the property or the precise set of characters to which it 
      applies are not yet definite and it therefore is too early to assign a 
      normative property. Even if there was a precise description of how to 
      interpret such a property, the fact that it is subject to a (planned) 
      revision makes relying on the specified behavior less interesting to 
      conforming implementations.</li>
    <li>Existing implementations show a range of behaviors for the same 
      character, many or all of which may be equally useful choices on the part 
      of their designers. Assigning a normative property would imply an 
      unwarranted restriction on existing and established practice.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>2.6 <a name="Referring"> Referring to Properties</a></h3> 
  <p>The Property Aliases [<a href="tr23-4.html#Alias">Alias</a>] and Property Value 
  Aliases [<a href="tr23-4.html#ValueAlias">ValueAlias</a>] define        
  a set of names and abbreviations that are used to refer to properties and        
  property values. These names can be used for XML formats of data in 
  the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/ucd/">Unicode        
  Character Database</a> [<a href="tr23-4.html#UCD">UCD</a>], for regular-expression        
  property tests, and other programmatic textual descriptions of Unicode data.        
  The names themselves are not normative, except where they correspond to        
  normative properties in the UCD. The names may be translated in appropriate environments, and additional        
  aliases may be useful. The case distinctions, whitespace, and '_' in the        
  property names are not normative and unless a specific form is required in a        
  particular application, all forms are equivalent.</p>       
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Note:</b> For most properties, there is one abbreviated name and one long 
    name for each property. At any time, additional aliases may be 
    added. The property value names are <i>not</i> unique across properties. For 
    example, <b>AL</b> means Arabic Letter for the Bidi_Class property, and <b>AL</b> 
    means Alpha_Left for the Combining_Class property, and <b>AL</b> means 
    Alphabetic for the Line_Break property. In addition, some property names may 
    be the same as some property value names. For example, <b>cc</b> means 
    Combining_Class property, and <b>cc</b> means the General_Category property 
    value Control (cc). The combination of property value and property name is, 
    however, unique. For more information, see <a href="../tr18.1">UTR

  <p>[<a href="tr23-4.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] Section 3.1 gives                                  
  a prescription for referencing properties:&nbsp;</p>                                
  <blockquote class="tus">
  <p><b><i> References to Unicode Character

  <p> Properties and property values have defined names and   
  abbreviations, such as: Property: General_Category (gc); Property Value:   
  Uppercase_Letter (Lu).</p>  
  <p>To reference a given property and

  <blockquote>
    <p>The property value  
    Uppercase_Letter from the General_Category property, as defined in Unicode  
    3.2.0</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Then cite that version of the  
  standard, using the standard citation format that is provided for each version  
  of the Unicode Standard. For Unicode 3.2.0, it is:</p>

  <h3>2.7 <a name="CharacterDatabase"> The Unicode Character Database</a></h3>  
<p>The Unicode Character Database [<a href="tr23-4.html#UCD">UCD</a>] is the main   
  repository for machine readable character properties. It consists of a    
  number of files containing property data along with documentation files that    
  explain the organization of the database and the format and meaning of the    
  property data in the files. The <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeCharacterDatabase.html">Unicode    
  Character Database</a> file explains the overall organization of the current    
  version of the UCD and tells which files explain specific data files.</p>   
<p>While the Unicode Consortium strives to minimize  
changes to character property data, occasionally the character properties for 
already encoded characters must be  
updated. When this situation occurs, the relevant data files of the Unicode  
Character Database are revised. The revised data files are posted on the Unicode  
Web site as an update version of the standard.</p>   
<p>A visual documentation of character code point, character name and                           
reference glyph, together with&nbsp; excerpts from some of the character                           
properties and augmented by additional annotations can be found in the Character

  <h3><a name="Requirements">4.1 Conformance Requirements</a></h3>

  semantics of a character are established by taking its coded representation,                              
  character name and representative glyph in context and are further defined by                              
  its normative properties and behavior. Neither character name nor                              
  representative glyphs can be relied upon absolutely; a character may have a                              
  broader range of use than the most literal interpretation of its character

	<h2>5. <a name="Maintenance">Updating Properties and Extending the Standard</a>&nbsp;</h2>                            
  <h3><a name="Updating">5.1 Updating Properties</a></h3>                            
  <p>Updates to the Unicode Character Database can be required for three reasons</p>
  <ol>
    <li>To cover new characters added to the Unicode Standard</li>
    <li>To add new properties</li>
    <li>To change the assigned values for a property for some characters</li>
  </ol>
  While the Unicode Consortium will endeavor to keep the values of all character                           
      properties as stable as possible, some circumstances may arise that                           
      require changing them. Changing a characters property assignment invalidates existing                           
  implementations and is therefore something that is done judiciously and with                           
  great care, and only when there is no better alternative.                          
      <p>In particular, as Unicode encodes less-well  
      documented scripts (such as for minority languages in Thailand) the exact  
      character properties and behavior may not be known at the time the script  
      is first encoded; <span style="background-color: #F0F0FF">they are 
		expected to be </span>changed as information becomes available.
      <p><span style="background-color: #F0F0FF"><span class="changed">In some cases, as 
		implementation experience grows, a readjustment of property values may 
		become necessary. As much as possible, such readjustments are carried 
		out to be compatible in their effects for existing successful 
		implementations. Occasionally, a change to a character property is maded to prevent incorrect generalizations of a use of 
		character based on its nominal property values. For example U+200B ZERO 
		WIDTH SPACE is was originally classified as a space character (General 
		Category=Zs) but is now classified as a Formal Control (gc=Cf) to 
		distinguish this line break control from space characters.</span></span><p>In other cases, there may have been unintentional mistakes in the 
      original information that require corrections.
	<p><span class="changed">The [<a href="tr23-4.html#UTC">UTC</a>] 
	carefully weighs the costs of a change to the benefit of the correction. In 
	addition,</span> all updates to properties 
      are subject to the stability guarantees described in the next section.<br>
  <h3><a name="Guarantees">5.2 Stability Guarantees</a></h3>
  <p class="mainItem">Unicode guarantees the stability of character assignments, 
  that is, the <i>identity</i> of a character encoded at a given location will 
  remain the same. Once<b> </b>a character is encoded, its properties may still 
  be changed, but <i>not</i>  in such a way as to change  
      the fundamental identity of the character.</p> 
  <p> For example, the representative glyph for                      
      U+0061 &quot;A&quot; could not be changed to &quot;B&quot;; the general                      
      category for U+0061 &quot;A&quot; could not be changed to Ll <i>(lowercase                      
      letter);</i> and the decomposition mapping for U+00C1 (Á) could not be                      
      changed to &lt;U+0042, U+0301&gt; (B, ´).</p>                     
  <p>In addition, for some properties, one or more of the following aspects are guaranteed to be   
  invariant.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;stability of assignment&nbsp;</li>                            
    <li>&nbsp;stability of result when applying the property</li>                           
    <li>&nbsp;stability of set of values for a property</li>                            
    <li>&nbsp;stability of relation to another property</li>                            
    <li>&nbsp;stability of file formats</li>                            
  </ul>
  <p>For the most up-to-date   
  specification of all stability guarantees in effect see the <i> Unicode Stability   
  Policy</i> [<a href="tr23-4.html#Stability">Stability</a>]. Note that the status of a property
  as normative does not imply a stability guarantee.</p> 
  <h4>5.2.1 Stability of Assignment</h4> 
  <p>Stability of assignment is the definition of an immutable property. For 
  example, once a character is encoded, its code point and name are   
      immutable properties. The main benefit of an immutable property is to 
  allow software and documents to refer to its values without the need to track 
  future updates to the Standard. One side effect of an immutable property is 
  that errata cannot be fixed. For example, mistakes in naming are noted in the nameslist in a note or by using an   
      alias, but the formal name remains unchanged, even in cases of clear-cut 
  typographical errors.</p> 
  <p>Because the code point is an immutable property, if a character is ever 
  found to not be needed, or to be a mistaken duplicate of an existing 
  character, it will not be removed. Instead, it will be given an additional 
  property, <i>deprecated</i>, and its use will be strongly discouraged. 
  However, its identity remains intact, and all existing documents containing 
  the character remain well-defined.</p> 
<h4>5.2.2 Stability of Result when Applying the Property</h4> 
      <p>Stability of result is the definition of a stable property. For 
      example, once a character is encoded, its canonical combining class and  
      decomposition (canonical or compatibility) are stable with respect to  
      normalization. Stability with respect to normalization is defined in such 
      a way that if a string contains only characters from a given version of the  
      Unicode Standard (say Unicode 3.2), and it is put into a normalized form  
      in accordance with that version of Unicode, then it will be in normalized  
      form when normalized according to any past or future versions of Unicode.</p> 
  <p><span class="changed">However, unlike character code and 
	character name,</span> some properties that are guaranteed to be stable may be corrected in 
  <i>   
  exceptional</i> circumstances <span style="background-color: #F0F0FF">that are clearly defined by the Unicode 
  Stability Policy</span> [<a href="tr23-4.html#Stability">Stability</a>]. In addition to other 
  requirements, the correction must be of an obvious mistake, such as a    
  typographical error, and any alternative would violate the stability of the    
  identity of the character in question. <span style="background-color: #F0F0FF">The intent of this is to obviate the need for    
  encoding duplicate characters simply to correct clerical or other clear-cut    
  errors in property assignments.</span></p>   
<h4>5.2.3 Stability of Set of Values for a Property</h4>  
  For most properties, additional property values may be created and assigned to                          
  both new and existing characters. For example additional line breaking classes                          
  will be assigned if characters are discovered to require line breaking                          
  behavior that cannot be expressed with the existing set of classes. For other                          
  properties the set of values is guaranteed to be fixed, or their range is                          
  limited. For example, the set of values for the General Category or                          
  Bidirectional Class is fixed, while Combining classes are limited to the values 0 to 255.                          
<h4>5.2.4 Stability of Relation to Another Property</h4> 
  In many cases, once a character has a certain value for one property, it is                          
  likely to have a particular value for a given other property. These relations                          
  are used by the Unicode Consortium in assigning properties to new characters,                          
  and in evaluating properties for internal consistency. In some cases, such                          
  dependencies are explicitly guaranteed and stable.                         
  <p>For example, all characters other than those of General Category M* have the  
          combining class 0.</p> 
<h4>5.2.5 Stability of File Formats</h4> 
  <p>In principle, the way the property information is presented in the Unicode 
  Character Database is independent of the way this information is defined. 
  However, as the Unicode Standard gets updated, it becomes easier for 
  implementations to track updates if file formats remain unchanged and other 
  aspects of the way the data are organized can remain stable. For the majority 
  of properties, such stability is an informal goal of the development process, 
  but in a few cases, some aspects of the data organization are covered by 
  formal stability guarantees.</p>
  <p>For example, Canonical and Compatibility mappings are always in canonical order,  
          and the resulting recursive decomposition will also be in canonical  
          order. Canonical mappings are also always limited either to a single value or to  
          a pair. The second character in the pair cannot itself have a  
          canonical mapping.</p> 
  <h3><a name="Consistency">5.3 Consistency of Properties</a></h3> 
  <p> In an ideal world, all character properties would be                         
  perfectly self-consistent, and related properties would be consistent with                         
  each other over the entire range of code points. However, The Unicode Standard                         
  is the product of many compromises. It has to strike a balance between                         
  uniformity of treatment for similar characters and compatibility with existing                         
  practice for characters inherited from legacy encodings. Because of this                         
  balancing act, one can expect a certain number of anomalies in character                         
  properties.</p>
  <p>Sometimes it may be advantageous for an implementation to                          
  purposefully override some of the anomalous property values, increasing the                          
  efficiency and uniformity of algorithms—as long as the results they                          
  produce do not conflict with those specified by the normative properties of                          
  this standard. See Chapter 4, <i>Character Properties</i> in [<a href="tr23-4.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] for some                          
  examples.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Property values assigned to new                         
  characters added to the Unicode Standard are generally defined so that related                         
  characters are given consistent values, unless deliberate exceptions are                         
  needed. For some properties,&nbsp; definite links between that property and                         
  one or more other properties are defined. For example for the LineBreak                         
  property, many line break classes are defined in relation to General Category                         
  values.</p>
  <h3><a name="Provisional">5.4 
  Provisional Properties</a></h3>
  <p> 
  Some of the information provided about characters in the Unicode Character 
  Database constitutes provisional data. Provisional property data may capture 
  partial or preliminary information. Such data may contain errors or omissions, 
  or otherwise not be ready for systematic use; however, provisional property 
  data are included in the data files for distribution partly to encourage 
  review and improvement of the information. For example, a number of the tags 
  in the Unihan database provide provisional property values of various sorts 
  about Han characters.</p> 
  <h3><a name="Unmaintained">5.5 Stabilized Properties</a></h3>
  <p> Occasionally, as the    
  standard matures, and new characters, properties or algorithms are defined the    
  information presented in an existing property may better represented via other    
  properties, or it may not make sense to extend the property to new characters.    
  Such property may then no longer be maintained in future versions of the    
  Unicode Standard. In that case it will be designated as Stabilized. For    
  backwards compatibility, a stabilized property will remain part of the Unicode    
  Character database, but will not be updated or corrected.</p>   
  <p>An example of a stabilized property is Hyphen.</p>
  <h2><a name="SpecialValues">6. Special Property Values</a></h2>
  <h3><a name="NA">6.1 N/A Value</a></h3>
  <p>Limited properties apply to only a subset of characters. Where these 
  properties are implemented as a partition (required property) the characters 
  to which the property does not apply is given a special value denoting that 
  the property does not apply.</p>
  <h3><a name="Default">6.2 Default Value</a></h3>
  <p>Implementations often need specific properties for <i>all</i> code points, 
  including those that are unassigned. To meet this need, the Unicode standard 
  assigns default properties to ranges of unassigned code points.</p>
  <p>All implementations of the Unicode Standard should endeavor to handle 
  additions to the character repertoire gracefully. In some cases this may 
  require that an implementation attempts to 'anticipate' likely property values 
  for Code points for which characters have not yet been defined, but where 
  surrounding characters exist that make it probable that similar characters 
  will be assigned to the Code point in question.</p>
  <p>There are three strategies</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Rely on the recommendation from The Unicode Consortium. For example, for 
      the Bidirectional Class, the Unicode Consortium has published recommended 
      default values for all code points.</li>
    <li>Treat the unassigned areas of a given character block as if they had 
      property values common to other characters of the block. A variation of 
      this scheme bridges small gaps in the allocation inside a block by using 
      the property values for the characters bracketing the hole.</li>
    <li>Give unassigned code location a implementation defined default property 
      that will result in graceful, if not completely correct behavior if 
      encoded characters are later encountered at that location.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Each of these strategies has advantages and drawbacks, and none can  
  guarantee that the behavior of an implementation that is conformant to a prior  
  version of the Unicode Standard will support characters added in a later  
  version of the Unicode Standard in precisely the same way as an implementation  
  that is conformant to the later version. The most that can be hoped for, is  
  that the earlier implementation will behave more gracefully in such circumstances.</p> 
  <p>Default values are temporary: they will be superseded by final assignments, 
  once characters are assigned to a given code point.</p>
  <p>For non-character codes, a property returning API would return the same 
  value as the default value for unassigned characters.</p>
  <h3><a name="Preliminary">6.3 Preliminary Property Assignments</a></h3> 
  <p>Sometimes, a determination and assignment of property values can be made,  
  but the information on which it was based may be incomplete or preliminary. In  
  such cases, the property value may be changed when better information becomes  
  available. Currently, there is no machine readable way to provide information  
  about the confidence of a property assignment; however, the text of the  
  Standard or a Technical Report defining the property may provide general  
  indications of preliminary status of property assignments where they are  
  known.</p>
  <p>This is distinct from <a href="tr23-4.html#ProvisionalProperty">provisional properties</a>, 
  where the entire property is preliminary.</p>
