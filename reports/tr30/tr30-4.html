	<h2><a name="_Toc1"></a>1 Scope</h2>
	<p>This report identifies a set of character foldings, in other words, operations 
	that map similar characters to a common target. <span class="old-changed">Folding 
	operations are most often used to temporarily </span>ignore certain distinctions 
	between similar characters. For example, they are useful for &quot;fuzzy&quot; or 
	&quot;loose&quot; searches. <span class="old-changed">More rarely, certain folding operations 
	may be used to permanently remove distinctions.</span> Each of the folding operations 
	specified in this report has well-understood properties, and is appropriate 
	in specific contexts. For example some identifiers need case folding, some do 
	not. Some text searches need to preserve superscript forms such as the <i>trademark 
	symbol </i>™, while others do not. For those and similar reasons, not all of 
	these folding operations may be appropriate in a given context. See
	Section 5.2 <a href="tr30-4.html#_Toc52"><i><span class="changed">Problematical Foldings</span></i></a><span class="changed">./</span>for some of the more problematic folding or 
	expansion operations.</p>
	<p>The report also provides an algorithm for combining these operations for 
	the purpose of searching or programmatic identifier matching.
	<span class="old-changed">This algorithm combines</span> canonical normalization 
	with optional folding operations. This allows implementers to decide which folding 
	option is useful for a particular purpose.</p>
	<h2><a name="_Toc2">2 </a>Introduction</h2>
	A folding function or folding operation removes a distinction between related 
	characters by mapping them to the same target. For example, a case folding 
	may remove the case distinction, by replacing upper and title case variants 
	of a character with the lower case. In other words, foldings define equivalence 
	classes, and chose a representative or target member for each equivalence class. 
	Applying a folding maps all members of the equivalence class to the target.<p>
	<span class="old-changed">Repeatedly applying the same folding does not change 
	the result, a property called <i>idempotency</i>. </span>
	<span class="changed">For example, case folding an already 
	case folded string makes no further changes to the string. </span></p>
	<p><span class="old-changed">Foldings have a <i>domain</i> of operation. All 
	characters not in this domain are left unchanged. Two foldings that otherwise 
	perform the same operation are distinct if their domain of operation is different.</span>
	<span class="changed">For example, case folding could be separated 
	by script, creating a Latin case folding, Greek case folding, etc. While each 
	implements the same operation, removing case distinction, they would be considered 
	different foldings.</span></p>
	<p><span class="old-changed">Since foldings remove distinctions, they lose information. 
	For that reason it is not possible to construct an inverse operation, except 
	in the trivial case of an identity folding.</span></p>
	<p>Foldings can be applied transiently, for example the same folding can be 
	applied to two strings before comparison, or they can be used to permanently 
	transform a text, for example when applying the Positional Forms Folding to 
	convert legacy data that uses explicit Arabic positional shapes to the generic 
	Arabic characters with implicit directionality.</p>
	<p><span class="old-changed">In a more general sense, the elements of equivalence 
	classes or the target of a folding may be character sequences, such as combining 
	character sequences. Examples are the Katakana foldings where voiced syllables 
	are written with two characters for halfwidth Katakana and single characters 
	otherwise (<b>&#65398;</b> <b>+</b> <b>&#65438;</b> <b>&#8594;</b> <b>&#12460;</b>). A character may be 
	folded differently when it is part of different character sequences or when 
	it is by itself. This means that foldings in general are context sensitive. 
	Finally, the output of a folding operation, whether context sensitive or not, 
	may result in a string that is longer or shorter than the input string.</span></p>
	<p>For formal definitions of string and folding functions and their classification 
	see UTR #23, <i><a href="../tr23.1">Unicode Character 
	Property Model</a></i> [<a href="tr30-4.html#PropModel">PropModel</a>]</p>
	<h3><a name="_Toc21">2.1 Search Term Folding</a></h3>
	<p>For the purpose of fuzzy text matching, including both programmatic identifier 
	matching and general text searching, it is often necessary to selectively ignore 
	otherwise meaningful distinctions between related characters, for example upper 
	and lower case, <span class="old-changed">presence</span> of accent marks, etc. 
	This process can be called <i>search term folding</i>. Depending on the
	<span class="old-changed">search</span> operation, different foldings need to 
	be applied, and possible interactions <span class="old-changed">between foldings 
	and between folded characters and adjacent text that is not folded</span> must 
	be carefully managed, <span class="old-changed">as they can affect the result 
	of the search and introduce both</span> false positive or false negative matches.
	<span class="old-changed">The remainder of the document describes various foldings 
	and discusses their use in the context of search term folding.</span></p>
	<p><span class="changed">In the general case, different search 
	term foldings are applied for different languages. For example, accent distinctions 
	are ignorable for some languages, but not for others. In English the accent 
	in words like naïve is optional, while to a Swedish user &#39;o&#39; and &#39;ö&#39; are distinct 
	letters.</span></p>
	<p>A significant aspect of string foldings for programmatic <i>identifier matching</i> 
	is that the set of allowable <span class="old-changed">identifier</span> characters 
	is restricted. <span class="changed">Limiting the repertoire 
	of identifier characters effectively restricts the domain of any foldings applied 
	to them, thus avoiding some of the complications for identifier matching described 
	in Section 
	5.2 </span><a href="tr30-4.html#_Toc52"><i><span class="changed">Problematical Foldings</span></i></a><span class="changed">.</span></p>
	<h3><a name="_Toc22">2.2 Relation to Normalization</a></h3>
	<p>Normalization [<a href="tr30-4.html#Normalization">Normalization</a>] is part of any 
	robust search term folding algorithm (see Section 4.1.1 <a href="tr30-4.html#_Toc411">
	<i>Basic Folding Algorithm</i></a>). However, there are some important 
	differences between normalization and the foldings that make up search term 
	folding. Normalization, in particular the <i>canonical</i> forms (NFC or NFD), 
	is often intended for permanent transformation of data, while search 
	term <span class="old-changed">and other foldings </span>are by nature transient. 
	Further, unlike <span class="old-changed">most of</span> the other foldings 
	considered here, normalization it is not context-independent, since the equivalences 
	are not between characters, but character sequences.</p>
	<p>As defined, the normalization forms offer only two broad levels of distinctions 
	(they either preserve or do not preserve compatibility distinctions). 
	The choice of which distinctions may be ignored for search term folding needs 
	to be more specific; it depends on the nature of the operation. One size does 
	not fit all.</p>
	<p>For example, two of the normalization forms depend on compatibility mappings 
	which replace characters with their compatibility decompositions. Applying certain 
	of these compatibility mappings may lead to unintended false positive matches, 
	preventing their use in general text searches. In combination with whole word 
	search it could even lead to unintended false negatives. (See Section 5.2
	<a href="tr30-4.html#_Toc52"><i>Problematical foldings</i></a>).</p>
	<p>Furthermore, normalization and case folding are defined as separate and independent 
	operations, but case folding often occurs together with other foldings 
	in search term folding. In order to avoid inconsistencies, search term folding 
	needs to address the interaction of case folding with the other steps in the 
	algorithm.</p>
	<p>Search term folding includes canonical normalization; however, the choice 
	of using the composed (NFC) or decomposed Normalization Form (NFD) is of secondary 
	importance in terms of defining the foldings. Due to the transient nature of 
	search term folding, the distinction between NFC and NFD is immaterial, as long 
	as the two forms are not mixed. However, if the data is known to be in one of 
	the normalized forms, it would be computationally less expensive to operate 
	the search in that form.</p>
	<h3><a name="_Toc23">2.3 Relation to Collation</a></h3>
	<p>Like foldings, the comparisons at the heart of the
	<a href="../tr10/index.html">Unicode Collation Algorithm</a> 
	[<a href="tr30-4.html#UCA">UCA</a>] also define equivalences. One can derive a specific 
	folding by applying the collation algorithm with a particular strength and specific 
	tailorings (see [<a href="tr30-4.html#UCA">UCA</a>]). Foldings derived in this manner can 
	be useful in searches that ignore similar distinctions to those ignored in collation. 
	Such foldings are not subject of this report.</p>

	<h2>4<a name="_Toc4"> Specifications</a></h2>
	<p><span class="changed">This section gives the specification of a number of useful foldings 
	together with two algorithms that show how they can be applied in a 
	consistent manner, such that folded data is normalized, and folding of 
	normalized or unnormalized data gives the same results. The specification of 
	the foldings transforms data in both canonical normalization forms without 
	change in normalization form, so that they can be used with canonically 
	composed or decomposed data. Due to the context-dependent nature of 
	normalization, it is necessary to separately ensure that the folded data 
	including any surrounding characters remains normalized.</span></p>
	<h3><a name="_Toc41">4.1 Folding algorithm</a></h3>
	<p>All specifications of algorithms are in terms of results—all 
	implementations that achieve the same result are fully equivalent. In 
	particular, implementations commonly use optimization techniques, such as 
	normalizing and folding &#39;on demand&#39;.
	<span class="old-changed">In each of the following algorithms, 
	implementations may be able to avoid the loop implied by step </span><b>
	<span class="old-changed">(c)</span></b><span class="old-changed"> by 
	performing additional transformations whose effect ensures the folding is 
	stable under normalization.</span></p>
	<h4><a name="_Toc411">4.1.1 Basic Folding Algorithm</a></h4>
	<p>The basic algorithm for search term folding can be stated as</p>
	<p>a. Apply optional folding operations<br>
	b. Apply canonical decomposition<br>
	c. Repeat (<b>a</b>) and (<b>b</b>) until stable<br>
	d. Apply composition if necessary</p>
	<p>where each step is applied on the whole string, and applies to the result 
	of the preceding operation. </p>
	<h4><a name="_Toc412">4.1.2 Identifier Folding Algorithm</a></h4>
	<p>For identifier folding, it is important to account for prohibited characters. 
	This adds a new step (<b>e</b>). The modified basic algorithm then becomes:</p>
	<p>a. Apply optional folding operations <br>
	b. Apply canonical decomposition<br>
	c. Repeat (<b>a</b>) and (<b>b</b>) until stable<br>
	d. Apply composition if necessary<br>
	e. Eliminate or flag forbidden characters</p>
	<p>Foldings in step (<b>a</b>) can be modified to also disallow certain characters 
	by mapping them to forbidden characters, which are then caught in step (<b>e</b>).

	<h2><a name="_Toc5">5 Notes and Guidelines</a></h2>
	<h3><a name="_Toc51">5.1 General Notes</a></h3>
	<p>The most important guideline is &quot;discriminate&quot;. Understand the effect before 
	applying a folding. Do not apply any of these foldings just because 
	it exists, and certainly never all of them at once. The following notes on individual 
	foldings or issues may be of help in following this guideline.</p>
	<h4>5.1.1 Case Folding</h4>
	<p>The [<a href="tr30-4.html#CaseFolding">CaseFolding</a>] data file provides case folding 
	information. For more information see Section 5.18 <i>Case Mappings</i> in [<a href="tr30-4.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
	<h4>5.1.2 Diacritic Folding</h4>
	<p>Diacritic folding goes beyond the decomposition and removal of accents, umlauts, 
	cedillas etc. that is provided by the canonical decompositions, but also 
	includes barred, slashed forms etc, as well as hooks, descenders, etc.,&nbsp;
	<span class="changed">so that it is useful for purposes such 
	as cross language searching. For example, it would allow users to search for 
	words with accented characters in them by supplying the equivalent word spelled 
	in base letters only, eliminating the need to have access to the correct characters 
	on the keyboard. On the other hand, language-specific fuzzy searches would be 
	tailored, usually by being based on collation information, rather than on generic 
	diacritic folding. For more information about collation based searching, see 
	[</span><a href="tr30-4.html#UCA"><span class="changed">UCA</span></a><span class="changed">]</span></p>
	<h4>5.1.3 Letter Forms</h4>
	<p>Greek letter forms should be folded for Greek text. They should <b>not</b> 
	be folded for mathematical and scientific usage as doing so would conflate very 
	distinct concepts. To give an example of common usage, consider physics, which 
	distinguishes angle encoded by <i>theta</i> <i>&quot;&#952;&quot;</i> and temperature encoded 
	by <i>theta symbol</i> <i>&quot;&#977;&quot;</i>.</p>
	<p><span class="old-changed">The compatibility decompositions contain only a 
	subset of all the variant letter forms that could be folded for search purposes, including
	<i>Greek final sigma</i> and <i>Latin long s</i>.<i> Greek final sigma</i> should </span><b>
	<span class="old-changed">not</span></b><span class="old-changed"> be folded, 
	unless transiently. <i>Latin long s</i> should be folded for modern text in 
	roman type style but, other than transiently for searches, should not be folded 
	for texts intended to be set in Fraktur type. Other letterform foldings include 
	alternate Hebrew characters.</span></p>
	<h4>5.1.4 Han Character Foldings</h4>
	<p><span class="old-changed">There are a number of foldings applicable to Han 
	Ideographs. While the Unicode Consortium has not yet published any data file 
	defining these, they can be described in general terms.</span></p>
	<h5><i>Han Radical folding.</i> <span style="font-weight: 400">Han Radical 
	folding substitutes the corresponding Unified Ideograph for a Han Radical.</span></h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Note that the existing compatibility decomposition for Han Radicals 
		is inconsistent and should not be used for Han Radical folding.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b><i>Simplified / traditional folding. </i></b>
	Simplified and traditional forms of Han ideographs are separately encoded in 
	Unicode, even where they represent the same meaning. This folding removes 
	this distinction. In practice, there are additional differences in Han character 
	usage between writers of simplified and traditional Chinese, some of 
	which cannot be folded without context and semantic information. This simple  
	folding is nevertheless useful for many purposes.</p>
	<p><span class="changed">The mapping from traditional to simplified Chinese 
	is usually 1:1 but occasionally n:1. Because of this, the default is to fold 
	</span><i><span class="changed">to</span></i><span class="changed"> simplified Chinese. There are some cases where the traditional to 
	simplified mapping is 1:n or even m:n. In these cases the simplified Han folding 
	also removes some distinctions within simplified Chinese itself. For example, the simplified 
	Chinese character U+753B is folded to U+5212.</span></p>
	<p><b><i>Variant folding. </i></b>As results of historical 
	development of the Han ideograph there are multiple variations of characters 
	for the same concept, for example there are 47 variants for &#39;turtle&#39;. Such folding 
	would remove such variations. The process of defining such a folding for all 
	such cases will be difficult and lengthy.</p>
	<p><b><i>Source separation foldings. </i></b>The Unicode 
	Standard maintains duplications for certain Han ideographs based on the fact 
	that they were separately encoded <i>within</i> a given source character set. 
	A Han source separation folding would treat such separated characters as equivalent. 
	This is a subset of the generalized variant folding.</p>
	<h4>5.1.5 Kana Foldings</h4>
	<p>Japanese Katakana and Hiragana are two generally equivalent syllabaries, 
	where each Hiragana syllable has a corresponding Katakana syllable. Foldings 
	in both directions are useful, depending on the situation. However, since Katakana 
	are used to represent the pronunciation of foreign words in Japanese, there 
	are more Katakana than Hiragana characters. </p>
	<p>There is one important difference in orthography between the syllabaries, 
	affecting the way the long syllables are expressed. Hiragana uses an additional 
	vowel, while Katakana uses a length mark. If this is taken into account, the 
	folding is no longer context free. In fact, these are better seen as examples 
	of algorithmic transliterations, such as the ISCII transliterations between 
	Indic scripts.</p>
	<p><span class="changed">In addition, Katakana occur in both regular and 
	halfwidth forms, with the halfwidth forms using two characters to express voiced 
	or semi-voiced syllables, where the regular Katakana use a single character. 
	The [<a href="tr30-4.html#HiraganaFolding">HiraganaFolding</a>] folds Hiragana to wide 
	Katakana, while the [<a href="tr30-4.html#KatakanaFolding">KatakanaFolding</a>] folds 
	wide 
	Katakana characters to Hiragana.</span></p>
	<h4><span class="old-changed">5.1.6 Syllabic vowel foldings</span></h4>
	<p><span class="old-changed">Ethiopic is an example of an &quot;open alphasyllabary&quot; 
	where a single symbol represents a CV (consonant + vowel) pattern. In principle, 
	such a syllabary has several forms for each consonant C: one for each of the 
	vowels V, and one vowel-less form. However, not all forms are actually used 
	in a given syllabary.</span></p>
	<p><span class="old-changed">Vowels often appear in the wrong form in 
	electronic text due to input errors, incompatible input methods, 
	different spelling conventions, or where grammatical word inflections are primarily 
	expressed by a change of vowel, as is the case for Ethiopic. In such situations 
	it may make sense to fold away the vowel by converting all syllables in a string 
	that have the same consonant into a common reference form.</span></p>
	<p><span class="old-changed">The choice of reference form depends on the syllabary, 
	or more precisely on features of the languages that are using the syllabary. 
	For Ethiopic, a vowel-less form has been found to be the most practical target 
	for folding. </span></p>
	<p><span class="old-changed">For other syllabaries, vowel folding may not be 
	as useful.</span></p>
	<h4>5.1.7 Semantically neutral foldings</h4>
	<p>Semantically neutral foldings could be defined as those foldings that simply 
	remove a distinction that is more or less purely an artifact of the encoding 
	itself. Under the right circumstances, these foldings are in principle candidates 
	for permanent data transformation. This is primarily true for the canonical 
	decomposition and composition, but could also apply to text using the Arabic 
	positional forms. If such a text is converted to use non-positional forms, but 
	rendered via a standard Unicode rendering process, the appearance would be the 
	same (except for deliberately odd combinations of positional shapes). In practice 
	it is far more likely that the original data containing the positional forms 
	will display poorly on a system that expects characters with implicit positional 
	shaping. </p>
	<p>The following foldings can be considered semantically neutral</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Arabic positional forms folding</li>
		<li>Vertical forms folding</li>
		<li>Canonical decomposition and composition, excepting Han compatibility 
		ideographs.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note that Arabic positional folding, especially when intended as a permanent 
	data transformation, may need to introduce ZWJ or ZWNJ characters.</p>
	<h4><i>5.1.8 Foldings based on tailored collation data</i></h4>
	<p>Foldings based on tailored collation data would fold characters that are 
	&#39;nearly equivalent&#39; in a particular language. For example, a locale-based folding 
	for Swedish could follow common practice in Sweden and match the following pairs 
	of character sequences, among others, based on equivalence in pronunciation.</p>
	<table border="1" width="30%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
		<tr>
			<td width="25%" align="center" height="18">
			<p align="center">Ä</p>
			</td>
			<td width="25%" align="center" height="18">

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="25%" align="center" height="18">

			<p align="center">v</p>
			</td>
			<td width="25%" align="center" height="18">
			<p align="center">w</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>In other words, locale-based foldings would be different for some user groups 
	using the same script (in this case Latin). The recommended way to implement 
	locale-based searching based on sorting tables is found in [<a href="tr30-4.html#UCA
">UCA </a>].</p>
	<h4>5.1.9 Compatibility decompositions</h4>
	<p>Compatibility decomposition provides a fixed combination of several foldings 
	and expansions. It is in fact the source of most of the foldings in the table 
	in section 4.0. There are two ways to subdivide compatibility decompositions:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>by compatibility decomposition type (the value in &lt;&gt; in [<a href="tr30-4.html#UnicodeData">UnicodeData</a>], 
		e.g. &lt;super&gt;)</li>
		<li>by explicitly limiting the range of <i>source</i> characters</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The specifications in <a href="tr30-4.html#_Toc5">Section 5.0</a> use the first method, 
	whenever the compatibility tag is well defined and meaningful. Where it is too 
	broad, e.g., for the &lt;compat&gt; tag, foldings are further subdivided by 
	defining specific ranges of source characters.</p>
	<p>Using compatibility decomposition is convenient, since existing algorithms 
	for Normalization may provide them. However, the full decomposition includes 
	several foldings that may not be appropriate for the given purpose. By selectively 
	not applying the decomposition to certain character ranges given in Section 
	4.0, one can in effect limit the compatibility decomposition to only the desired 
	foldings.</p>
	<h3><a name="_Toc52">5.2 Problematic foldings or expansions</a></h3>
	<p>Some foldings can have unintended consequences, including inadvertent changes 
	in the semantics of the text. In most cases, it is best to be conservative and 
	avoid problematic foldings altogether. There are two general exceptions to this 
	rule. The first is the case of identifier matching. If a folding has a prohibited 
	character as one of the output characters, it will not match any legal identifier. 
	Therefore, for properly restricted inputs, one may safely use fixed combinations 
	of foldings, such as NFKC. The other exception is the case of more extensive 
	string pre-processing, discussed below.</p>
	<h4>5.2.1 Fraction expansion</h4>
	<p>Fraction expansion as defined in the compatibility decompositions can lead 
	to a drastic change of the semantics of a string and can lead to term boundary 
	issues for searching. For example: Expanding the fraction in this string: 
	&lt;<span class="name">DIGIT</span> 5, <span class="name">VULGAR FRACTION</span> <span class="name">ONE QUARTER</span>&gt; turns it into &lt;<span class="name">DIGIT</span>&nbsp;5, <span class="name">DIGIT</span>&nbsp;1, 
	<span class="name">FRACTION SLASH</span>, <span class="name">DIGIT</span>&nbsp;4&gt;. This now will be found by a search for &quot;51&quot;. Because 
	of the semantics of <span class="name">FRACTION SLASH</span> the expansion also changes the numeric value 
	from &quot;5 and a quarter&quot; into &quot;51 over 4&quot;. Fraction expansion is therefore best 
	avoided altogether.</p>
	<p>By modifying the fraction expansion from the standard compatibility decomposition 
	and inserting an appropriate space character, for example <span class="name">THIN SPACE</span>, before 
	the fraction, it is possible to prevent the expanded fraction from coalescing 
	with preceding digits. However, if there are no preceding digits, no <span class="name">THIN SPACE</span> 
	must be added, or strings containing the expanded fraction would no longer match 
	strings with already expanded fractions which presumably would not contain THIN 
	<span class="name">SPACE</span> characters. Finally, any space character would be subject to <i>space 
	folding</i>, which, if present would introduce a <span class="name">SPACE</span> character, possibly affecting 
	the search term.</p>
	<h4>5.2.2 Bullet expansions</h4>
	<p>If a circled bullet character is simply replaced by its contents, as when<i>
	</i>&nbsp;<span class="name">CIRCLED DIGIT</span>&nbsp;5 is replaced by <span class="name">DIGIT</span>&nbsp;5, the separation from the surrounding 
	text is lost, and the <span class="name">DIGIT</span>&nbsp;5 could run together with adjacent numbers. For 
	bullet characters using parenthesized or dotted letters or digit, this issue 
	is somewhat mitigated by fact that the bullet itself contains punctuation. Bullet 
	characters are commonly used like footnote marks to refer to other text, in 
	other words, they do not occur just at the beginning of bulleted lines.</p>
	<h4>5.2.3 Spacing accents substitution</h4>
	<p>Spacing accents are mapped by compatibility decomposition to <span class="name">SPACE</span> followed 
	by a non-spacing accent. This inappropriately introduces a space character into 
	the term, as well as introducing non-spacing marks where none were in the data 
	before. The former is especially problematic, where the matching operation is 
	affected by these spaces and combining characters.</p>
	<h4>5.2.4 Math folding</h4>
	<p>The set of compatibility decompositions includes the folding of letterlike 
	mathematical symbols to their nearest ASCII or Hebrew equivalent. In particular 
	the Hebrew characters used as letterlike symbols do not have RIGHT TO LEFT directionality 
	and the set of such letters in mathematical usage is sufficiently restricted 
	that such folding makes little sense in math, except in pure &#39;looks like&#39; style 
	searches.</p>
	<h4>5.2.5 Various &quot;cluster&quot; expansions</h4>
	<p>Unicode contains many clusters, <i>e.g.</i> square symbols, some of the letterlike 
	characters that are made up of several characters. &#39;Decomposing&#39; these may or 
	may not be the right thing for search equivalence. Parenthesized characters 
	and numbers would probably be immune to the term boundaries issues raised earlier, 
	but the story is less clear for others.</p>
	<h4>5.2.5 Jamo expansion</h4>
	<p>For more information on Jamo expansion see Section 11.4 <i>Hangul</i> in 
	[<a href="tr30-4.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
	<h4>5.2.6 Preserving semantics</h4>
	<p>To a limited extent, the problems surrounding bullet expansion can be mitigated 
	by inserting a <span class="name">THIN SPACE</span> around the expansion to set the expanded text off 
	from the surrounding text. However, this cannot be applied together with any 
	space folding, as otherwise the <span class="name">THIN SPACE</span> may become <span class="name">SPACE</span> and might be considered 
	a search term delimiter.</p>
	<h3><a name="_Toc53">5.3 Versioning and stability</a></h3>
	<p><span class="old-changed">As characters are added to [<a href="tr30-4.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] 
	many of them need to be added to the definition of foldings described here. 
	However, there are some exceptions, for example, few characters subject to [<a href="tr30-4.html#WidthFolding">WidthFolding</a>] 
	are expected to be added. The data files that are specifically associated with 
	this Technical Report contain a note discussing the expected level and type
