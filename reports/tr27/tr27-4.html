(ecclesiastical), but <i>Khutsuri</i> is not itself the name of a script form.                                                                             
Although no longer seen in most modern texts, the <i>Nuskhuri</i> style is still

by an alphabet called <i>Mkhedruli</i> (military), which is now the form used                                                                             
for nearly all modern Georgian writing.</p>                                                                            
<p><b><i>Case Forms</i></b>. The Georgian alphabet is fundamentally caseless,                                                                             
and is used as such in most texts. However, possibly owing to the influence of

uppercase capital letters. In this typographic departure, it is the <i>Asomtavruli</i>

or <i>Nuskhuri</i>. This usage parallels the evolution of the Latin alphabet, in                                                                             
which the original linear monumental style came to be considered uppercase,                                                                             
while manuscript styles of the same alphabet came to be represented as

and the basic alphabetic range U+10D0..U+10FF may be regarded as lowercase (<i>Mkhedruli</i>

<p>Among the designers of the Deseret Alphabet was George D. Watt, who had                                             
been trained in shorthand and served as Brigham Young's secretary.                                             
It is possible that, under Watt's influence, Sir Isaac Pitman's 1847

<p>The Church commissioned two typefaces and published four books using the

records, diaries, and other materials were handwritten using this script, and it                                             
had limited use on coins and signs. There is also one tombstone in Cedar City,                                             
Utah, written in the Deseret Alphabet. However, the script failed to gain wide acceptance and was not actively promoted after

LANGUAGE TAG is specified to constitute a language tag. Furthermore, the tag

<p>For example, consider embedding a language tag for Japanese. The Japanese tag

<p>Thus the entire language tag in its &quot;ja-JP&quot; would be converted to
