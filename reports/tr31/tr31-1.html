  <h2 align="left"><a name="Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>
  <p>A common task facing an implementer of the Unicode Standard is the 
  provision of a parsing and/or lexing engine for identifiers. To assist in the 
  standard treatment of identifiers in Unicode character-based parsers, a set of 
  specifications is provided here as a recommended default for the definition of 
  identifier syntax. These guidelines are no more complex than current rules in 
  the common programming languages, except that they include more characters of 
  different types.
  <p>In addition, this document provides a proposed definition of a set of 
  properties for use in defining stable pattern syntax: syntax that is stable 
  over future versions of the Unicode Standard.</p>
  <p class="reviewnote">Note to reviewers: Section 2 would eventually supersede <i>Section 
  5.15 Identifiers</i> from The Unicode Standard 4.0.</p>
  <h2>2. <a name="Default_Identifier_Syntax">Default Identifier Syntax</a></h2>
  <p>The formal syntax provided here is intended to capture the general intent 
  that an identifier consists of a string of characters that begins with a 
  letter or an ideograph, and then includes any number of letters, ideographs, 
  digits, or underscores. Each programming language standard has its own 
  identifier syntax; different programming languages have different conventions 
  for the use of certain characters from the ASCII range ($, @, #, _) in 
  identifiers. To extend such a syntax to cover the full behavior of a Unicode 
  implementation, implementers need only combine these specific rules with the 
  sample syntax provided here.
  <h4>Syntactic Rule</h4>
  <p><code>&lt;identifier&gt; := &lt;identifier_start&gt; (&lt;identifier_start&gt; 
  | &lt;identifier_extend&gt;)*</code>
  <p>Identifiers are defined by the following sets of character categories from 
  the Unicode Character Database.</p>
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1">
    <caption><b>Syntactic Classes for Identifiers</b></caption>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th align="left">Syntactic Class</th>
        <th align="left">Properties</th>
        <th align="left">Coverage</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>&lt;identifier_start&gt;</code></td>
        <td>General Category = L or Nl, or Other_ID_Start = true</td>
        <td>Uppercase letter, lowercase letter, titlecase letter, modifier 
          letter, other letter, letter number, stability extensions</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>&lt;identifier_extend&gt;</code></td>
        <td>General Category = Mn, Mc, Nd, Pc, or Cf</td>
        <td>Nonspacing mark, spacing combining mark, decimal number, connector 
          punctuation, formatting code</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>The innovations in the identifier syntax to cover the Unicode Standard 
  include the following:
  <ul>
    <li>Incorporation of proper handling of combining marks
    <li>Allowance for layout and format control characters, which should be 
      ignored when parsing identifiers</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.1 Combining Marks</h3>
  <p>Combining marks must be accounted for in identifier syntax. A composed 
  character sequence consisting of a base character followed by any number of 
  combining marks must be valid for an identifier. This requirement results from 
  the requirement for combining marks in the representation of many languages, 
  and the conformance rules in Chapter 3 regarding interpretation of 
  canonical-equivalent character sequences.
  <p>Enclosing combining marks (for example, <code>U+20DD..U+20E0</code>) are 
  excluded from the syntactic definition of <code>&lt;identifier_extend&gt;</code>, 
  because the composite characters that result from their composition with 
  letters (for example, U+24B6 <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">circled 
  latin capital letter a</span>) are themselves not normally considered valid 
  constituents of these identifiers.</p>
  <h3>2.2 Layout and Format Control Characters</h3>
  <p>The Unicode characters that are used to control joining behavior, 
  bidirectional ordering control, and alternative formats for display are 
  explicitly defined as not affecting breaking behavior. Unlike space characters 
  or other delimiters, they do not serve to indicate word, line, or other unit 
  boundaries. Accordingly, they should normally be ignored for the purposes of 
  identifier definition. Implementations that cannot ignore characters in 
  identifiers should exclude these characters.
  <h3>2.3 Specific Character Adjustments</h3>
  <p>Specific identifier syntaxes can be treated as tailorings of the generic 
  syntax based on character properties. For example, SQL identifiers allow an 
  underscore as an identifier part (but not as an identifier start); C 
  identifiers allow an underscore as either an identifier part or an identifier 
  start. Specific languages may also want to exclude the characters that have a <code>decomposition_type</code> 
  other than <code>canonical</code> or <code>none</code>, or to exclude some 
  subset of those, such as those with a <code>decomposition_type</code> equal to 
  <code>font</code>.
  <p>For programming language identifiers, normalization has a number of 
  important implications. For a discussion of these issues, see <a href="../tr15.1#Programming_Language_Identifiers">Annex 
  7: Programming Language Identifiers</a> in <i>UAX #15, Unicode Normalization 
  Forms</i> [<a href="tr31-1.html#UAX15">UAX15</a>].</p>
  <p class="reviewnote"><i>Note to reviewers:</i> Would it be better to move 
  that section into this UTR. Comments? </p>
  <h3>2.4 Backward Compatibility</h3>
  <p>Unicode General Category values are kept as stable as possible, but they 
  can change across versions of the Unicode Standard. The Other_ID_Start 
  property contains a small list of characters that qualified as <code>&lt;identifier_start&gt;</code> 
  characters in some previous version of Unicode solely on the basis of their 
  General Category properties, but that no longer qualify in the current 
  version. In Unicode 4.0, this list consists of four characters:
  <ul>
    <li>U+2118 <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">script capital p</span>
    <li>U+212E <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">estimated symbol</span>
    <li>U+309B <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">katakana-hiragana voiced 
      sound mark</span>
    <li>U+309C <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">katakana-hiragana 
      semi-voiced sound mark</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Other_ID_Start property is thus designed to ensure that the Unicode 
  identifier specification is backward compatible: Any sequence of characters 
  that qualified as an identifier in some version of Unicode will continue to 
  qualify as an identifier in future versions.</p>
  <h2>3. <a name="Alternative_Identifier_Syntax">Alternative Identifier Syntax</a></h2>
  <p>The down-side of working with the syntactic classes defined above is the 
  storage space needed for the detailed definitions, plus the fact that with 
  each new version of the Unicode Standard new characters are added, which an 
  existing parser would not be able to recognize. In other words, the 
  recommendations based on that table are not upwardly compatible.
  <p>One method to address this problem is to turn the question around. Instead 
  of defining the set of code points that are allowed, define a small, fixed set 
  of code points that are reserved for syntactic use and allow everything else 
  (including unassigned code points) as part of an identifier. All parsers 
  written to this specification would behave the same way for all versions of 
  the Unicode Standard, because the classification of code points is fixed 
  forever.
  <p>The drawback of this method is that it allows “nonsense” to be part of 
  identifiers because the concerns of lexical classification and of human 
  intelligibility are separated. Human intelligibility can, however, be 
  addressed by other means, such as usage guidelines that encourage a 
  restriction to meaningful terms for identifiers. For an example of such 
  guidelines, see the XML 1.1 specification by the W3C [<a href="tr31-1.html#XML1.1">XML1.1</a>].
  <p>By increasing the set of disallowed characters, a reasonably intuitive 
  recommendation for identifiers can be achieved. This approach uses the full 
  specification of identifier classes, as of a particular version of the Unicode 
  Standard, and permanently disallows any characters not recommended in that 
  version for inclusion in identifiers. All code points unassigned as of that 
  version would be allowed in identifiers, so that any future additions to the 
  standard would already be accounted for. This approach ensures both upwardly 
  compatible identifier stability and a reasonable division of characters into 
  those that do and do not make human sense as part of identifiers.
  <p>Some additional extensions to the list of disallowed code points can be 
  made to further constrain “unnatural” identifiers. For example, one could 
  include unassigned code points in blocks of characters set aside for future 
  encoding as symbols, such as mathematical operators.
  <p>With or without such fine-tuning, such a compromise approach still incurs 
  the expense of implementing large lists of code points. While they no longer 
  change over time, it is a matter of choice whether the benefit of enforcing 
  somewhat word-like identifiers justifies their cost.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, one can use the properties described below, and allow all 
  sequences of characters to be identifiers that are neither pattern syntax nor 
  pattern whitespace. This has the advantage of simplicity and small tables, but 
  allows many more “unnatural” identifiers.</p>
  <h2>4. <a name="Pattern_Syntax">Pattern Syntax</a></h2>
  <p>There are many circumstances where software interprets patterns that are a 
  mixture of literal characters, whitespace, and syntax characters. Examples 
  include regular expressions, Java collation rules, Excel or ICU number 
  formats, and many others. These patterns have been very limited in the past, 
  and forced to use clumsy combinations of ASCII characters for their syntax. As 
  Unicode becomes ubiquitous, some of these will start to use non-ASCII 
  characters for their syntax: first as more readable optional alternatives, 
  then eventually as the standard syntax.</p>
  <p>For forwards and backwards compatibility, it is very advantageous to have a 
  fixed set of whitespace and syntax code points for use in patterns. This 
  follows the recommendations that the Unicode Consortium made regarding 
  completely stable identifiers, and the practice that is seen in XML 1.1 [<a href="tr31-1.html#XML1.1">XML1.1</a>]. 
  (In particular, the consortium committed to not allocating characters suitable 
  for identifiers in the range 2190..2BFF, which is being used by XML 1.1.)</p>
  <p>With a fixed set of whitespace and syntax code points, a pattern language 
  can then have a policy requiring all possible syntax characters (even ones 
  currently unused) to be quoted if they are literals. By using this policy, it 
  preserves the freedom to extend the syntax in the future by using those 
  characters. Past patterns on future systems will always work; future patterns 
  on past systems will signal an error instead of silently producing the wrong 
  results.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Example:</i></p>
    <p>In version 1.3 of program X, '≈' is a reserved syntax character, e.g. 
    it doesn't perform an operation, but you have to quote it. In version 1.4, 
    '≈' gets a real meaning, e.g. uppercase the subsequent characters. In this 
    example, '\' <i>quotes</i> the next character; i.e., causes it to be treated 
    as a literal instead of a syntax character.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The pattern abc...\≈...xyz works on both version 1.3 and 1.4, and 
        refers to the literal character since it is quoted in both cases.
      <li>The pattern abc...≈...xyz works on 1.1 and uppercases the following 
        characters. On version 1.0, the engine (rightfully) has no idea what to 
        do with ≈. Rather than silently fail (by ignoring ≈ or turning it 
        into a literal), it has the opportunity signal an error.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This document provides a recommended set of code points that can be used 
  for such pattern whitespace and syntax characters. Particular pattern 
  languages may, of course, override these recommendations (for example, adding 
  or removing other characters for compatibility in ASCII). But by providing a 
  list of these in UCD properties, a stable, common basis for future expansion.</p>
  <p>For stability, the property values will be absolutely invariant; not 
  changing with successive versions of Unicode. Of course, this doesn't limit 
  the ability of the Unicode Standard to add more symbol or whitespace 
  characters, but the syntax and whitespace characters recommended for use in 
  patterns would not change.</p>
  <p>When <i>generating</i> rules or patterns, all whitespace and syntax code 
  points that are to be literals would require quoting. For readability, it is 
  recommended practice to quote or escape all whitespace and default ignorable 
  code points as well. That is, </p>
  <p>The two proposed pattern properties to for the next appropriate version of 
  the UCD are Pattern_White_Space and Pattern_Syntax. The contents are presented 
  here for review; they would be removed once incorporated into the [<a href="tr31-1.html#UCD">UCD</a>]. 
  The contents were derived as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The proposed Pattern_White_Space characters were <i>originally </i>derived 
      from White_Space by removing some characters that appeared inappropriate 
      for patterns, and adding LRM and RLM. However, once we settle on their 
      contents, they would be immutable from then on.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The LRM and RLM are added so as to allow easier use of Arabic and 
          Hebrew in Patterns. For example, a rule like:</p>
          <p>X / W =&gt; Y* / Z ;</p>
          <p>becomes almost unreadable when some of the W..Z are right-to-left (RTL) 
          characters (e.g. Arabic or Hebrew) and others are left-to-right (LTR) 
          characters. However, by surrounding the RTL strings by LRM (or the LTR 
          characters by RLM), the rules can be made readable.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="reviewnote"><i>Note to reviewers:</i> A tighter definition 
          would result from removing all compatibility characters, leaving only 
          U+0009..U+000D, U+0020, U+0085, U+200E..U+200F, and U+2028..U+2029. 
          Would it be better to have this narrower definition? Should U+3000 be 
          at least retained?</p>
