  <blockquote>
	<p><em><a name="script">Script</a></em>: A collection of symbols used to 
	represent textual information in one or more writing systems.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The majority of characters encoded 
	in the Unicode Standard [<a href="../tr41/tr41-1.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] are elements of 
	collections called scripts. Exceptions include symbols, punctuation 
	characters intended for use with multiple scripts, and characters that do 
	not have a stand-alone script identity because they are intended to be used 
	in combination with another character.</p>
	<p>Therefore, a text in a 
	given script is likely to consist of characters from that script, together 
	with shared punctuation and characters whose script identity depends on the 
	characters with which they are used.</p>
	<h3 class="section"><a name="Classification">1.1</a>&nbsp;Classification of 
	Text by 
	Script Name</h3>
	<p>The <a href="http://www.unicode.org/ucd/">Unicode Character Database</a> 
  	[<a href="../tr41/tr41-1.html#UCD">UCD</a>] provides a mapping from Unicode characters to script name 
	values. 
  This information is useful for a 
	variety of tasks that need to analyze a piece of text and determine what 
	parts of it are in which script. Examples include regular expressions or 
	assigning different fonts to parts of a plain text stream based on the 
	prevailing script.</p>
	<p>These processes are similar to the task of bibliographers in cataloging documents by their 
	script. However, bibliographers often ignore small inclusions of other scripts in 
	the form of 
	quoted material in cataloging. Conversely, significant 
	differences in the writing style for the same script may be reflected in the 
	bibliographical classification—for example, Fraktur or Gaelic for the Latin script.</p>
	<p>Script information is also taken into consideration 
	in collation. The data in the Default Unicode Collation Element Table (DUCET) 
	are grouped by script, so that letters of different script values have 
	different primary sort weights. However, numbers, symbols, and punctuation are not 
	grouped with the letters. For the purposes of ordering, therefore, script is 
	most significant for the letters. For more information, see Unicode 
	Technical Standard #10, “<a href="../tr10/index.html">Unicode Collation Algorithm</a>”<i>
	</i>[<a href="../tr41/tr41-1.html#UCA">UCA</a>].</p>
	<p>These examples demonstrate that 
	the definition of <i>script</i> depends on the intended purposes 
	of the classification. <i>Table 1</i> summarizes 
	some of the purposes for which text elements can be classified by 
	script.</p>

  </center>
	<p>Bibliographical, graphological, or historical 
	classifications of scripts need different distinctions than the type of 
	text-processing–related needs supported by Unicode script values. The 
	requirements of the task not only affect how fine-grained the classification is, but also 
	what 
	kinds of special values are needed to make the system work. For example, when 
	bibliographers are unable to determine the script of a document, they may 
	classify it using a special value for <b>Unknown</b>. In text processing, 
	the identities of all characters are normally known, but some characters may 
	be 
	shared across scripts or attached to any character, thus requiring 
	special values for <b>Common</b> and <b>Inherited</b>.</p>
	<p>Despite these differences, the vast majority of 
	Unicode script values correspond more or less directly to the script identifiers used by bibliographers 
	and others. Unicode script values are therefore mapped to their equivalents 
	in the registry of script 
	identifiers defined by [<a href="../tr41/tr41-1.html#ISO15924">ISO15924</a>]. </p>
	<h3 class="section"><a name="Scripts_and_Blocks">1.2</a> Scripts and 
	Blocks</h3>
	<p>Unicode characters are also divided into non-overlapping ranges called 
	blocks 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-1.html#Blocks">Blocks</a>]. Many of these blocks have the same name as one of the scripts 
	because 
	characters of that script are primarily encoded in that block. 
	However, blocks and scripts differ in the following 
	ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blocks are simply ranges, and often contain code points that are unassigned.</li>
    <li>Characters from the same script may be in several different blocks.</li>
    <li>Characters from different scripts may be in the same block.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As a result, for mechanisms such as regular expressions, using script values produces 
	more meaningful results than simple matches based on block names. </p>
  <p>For more information, see <i>Annex A, Character Blocks,</i> in <a href="../tr18.1#Character_Blocks">
	Unicode Technical Standard #18, </a>“<a href="../tr18.1#Character_Blocks">Unicode Regular Expressions</a><i>&quot;</i> [<a href="../tr41/tr41-1.html#RegEx">RegEx</a>].</p>
	<h2 class="section"><a name="Usage_Model">2</a> Usage Model</h2>
  <p>The script values form a full partition of the codespace: every code point 
	is assigned a single script value. This value 
  either a specific script value, such as <b>Cyrillic,</b> or one of the following three 
	special values: </p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Inherited</b>—for 
		characters that may be used with multiple scripts, and inherit their 
		script from the preceding characters. Includes nonspacing marks, 
		enclosing marks, and the zero width joiner/non-joiner characters. 
		</li>
		<li><b>Common</b>—for other 
		characters that may be used with multiple scripts. </li>
		<li><b>Unknown</b>—for 
		unassigned, private-use, and noncharacter code points.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As new scripts are 
	added to the standard, more script values will be added. See <span class="section">Section </span><span class="secno">3.2,</span> 
  <i><a href="tr24-9.html#Assignment_Script_Values">Assignment of Script Values</a>.</i></p>
	<p>A 
  character is assigned a specific Unicode script value (as opposed to <b>Common</b> or <b>Inherited</b>) 
	only when it is clearly not used with other scripts. This facilitates the 
	use of the Script property for common tasks such as regular expressions, but 
	means that some characters that are&nbsp;definite members of a given script by 
	their graphology nevertheless are assigned one of the generic values.
	As more data on the usage of individual characters 
	is collected, the script value assigned to a character may change. If it 
	becomes established that a character is regularly used with more than one 
	script, it will be assigned the <b>Common</b> value, where previously it 
	would have had a 
	more specific script value. However, the opposite type of change is possible as 
	well.</p>
  <h3 class="section"><a name="Common">2.1</a> Handling Characters with the Common 
	Script Property</h3>
	<p>In determining the boundaries of a run of text in a 
	given script, programs must
	resolve any of the special script values, such 
	as <b>Common,</b> based on the context of the surrounding characters. 
  A simple heuristic uses the script of the preceding character, which 
  works well in many cases. However, this may not always produce optimal 
  results. For example, in the text “... gamma (γ) is ...”, this 
  heuristic would cause matching parentheses to be in different scripts. </p>
	<p>Generally, paired punctuation, such as brackets or quotation marks, belongs 
	to the enclosing or outer level of the text and should therefore match the 
	script of the enclosing text. In addition, opening and closing elements of a 
	pair resolve to the same script values, where possible. The use of quotation 
	marks is language dependent; therefore it is not possible to tell from the 
	character code alone whether a particular quotation mark is used as an 
	opening or closing punctuation. For more information, see <i>Section 6.2, 
	General Punctuation,</i> of [<a href="../tr41/tr41-1.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
	<p>Some characters that are normally 
	used as paired punctuation may also be used singly. An example is U+2019
	<span class="name">RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION 
	MARK</span>, which is also used as
	<i>apostrophe,</i> in which case it no longer acts as an enclosing 
	punctuation. An example from physics would be &lt;<span class="mathsym2">ψ</span>| 
	or |<span class="mathsym2">ψ</span>&gt;, where the enclosing 
	punctuation characters may not form consistent pairs.</p>
	<h3 class="section"><a name="Nonspacing_Marks">2.2</a> Handling Nonspacing Marks</h3>
	<p>Implementations that determine the boundaries between 
	characters of given scripts should never break between a nonspacing mark (a character with General_Category value of Mn or Me) and its base 
	character. Thus, for boundary determinations and similar sorts of processing, 
	a nonspacing mark—whatever its script value—should inherit the script 
	value of its base character.</p>
	<p> Normally, a nonspacing mark has the  
	<b>Inherited</b> script value to 
      reflect this. However, in cases where the best interpretation of a 
      nonspacing mark <i>in isolation</i> would be a specific script, its 
      script property value may be different from <b>Inherited</b>. 
	For example, the Hebrew marks and 
	accents are used only with Hebrew characters and are therefore assigned the
	<b>Hebrew</b> script value.</p>
	<h3 class="section"><a name="Script_Names_in_RegEx">2.3</a> Using Script Names in Regular Expressions</h3>
  <p>The script property is useful in regular expression syntax for easy 
	specification of spans of text that consist of a single script or mixture 
	of scripts. In general, regular expressions should use specific script values 
	only in conjunction 
  with both <b>Common</b> and <b>Inherited</b>. For example, to distinguish a 
  sequence of characters appropriate for <b>Greek</b>, one would use</p>
  <p align="center"><code>((Greek | Common) (Inherited | 
  Me | Mn)?)*</code></p>
  <p>The preceding expression matches all characters that are either in <b>Greek</b> or in <b>Common</b> 
	and which are 
  optionally followed by characters in <b>Inherited</b>. For completeness, the 
	regular expression also allows any nonspacing or enclosing mark. </p>
	<p>Some languages commonly use 
  multiple scripts, so for <b>Japanese</b> one might use</p>
  <p align="center"><code>((Hiragana | Katakana | Han | Latin | Common) 
  (Inherited | Me | Mn)?)*</code></p>
	<p>Note that while it is necessary to include Latin 
	in the preceding expression to ensure that it can cover the typical script use 
	found in many Japanese texts, doing so would make it difficult 
	to isolate a run of Japanese inside an English document, for example. For more information, see Unicode Technical Standard 
	#18, “<a href="../tr18.1">Unicode Regular Expressions</a>” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-1.html#RegEx">RegEx</a>].</p>
  <h3 class="section"><a name="Limitations">2.4</a> Limitations</h3>
	<p>The script 
  values form a full partition of the Unicode codespace, but that partition 
  does not exhaust the possibilities for useful and relevant script-like subsets 
  of Unicode characters.</p>
  <p>For example, a user might wish to define a regular expression to span 
  typical mathematical expressions, but the subset of Unicode characters used in 
  mathematics does not correspond to any particular script. Instead, it requires 
  use of the <b>Math</b> property, other character properties, and particular 
  subsets of Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic letters. For information on other 
  character properties, see the [<a href="../tr41/tr41-1.html#UCD">UCD</a>].</p>
	<p>In texts of an academic, 
	scientific, or engineering nature, the use of isolated Greek characters is 
	common—for example,	Ω for ohm; α, β, and γ for types of 
	radioactive decays or in names of chemical compounds; π for 3.1415..., and 
	so on. 
	It is generally undesirable to treat such usage the same as ordinary text in the Greek script. 
	Some commonly used 
	characters, such as µ, already exist twice in the Unicode Standard, but with 
	different script values.</p>
  <h3 class="section"><a name="Spoofing">2.5</a> Spoofing</h3>
	<p>The script property values may also be useful in 
  providing users feedback to signal possible spoofing, where 
  visually similar characters (<i>confusable characters</i>) are substituted in 
  an attempt to mislead a user. For example, a domain name such as <code>macchiato.com</code> 
  could be spoofed with <code>macchiatο.com</code> (using U+03BF <span class="name">GREEK LETTER SMALL 
	LETTER OMICRON</span> for the first “o”) 
  or <code>maссhiato.com</code> (using U+0441 <span class="name">CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER ES</span> for the first 
	two “c”s). The user can 
  be alerted to odd cases by displaying mixed scripts with different colors, 
  highlighting, or boundary marks: <code>macchiat<span class="boundary">ο</span>.com</code> 
  or <code>ma<span class="boundary">сс</span>hiato.com</code>, for example.</p>
  <p>Possible spoofing is not limited to mixtures of 
  scripts. Even in ASCII, there are confusable characters such as 0 and O, or 1 
  and l. For a more complete approach, the use of script values needs to be augmented with other 
  information such as General_Category values and lists of 
  individual characters that are not distinguished by other Unicode properties. 
	For additional information, see Unicode Technical Report #36, “<a href="../tr36/index.html">Unicode Security 
	Considerations</a>” [<a href="../tr41/tr41-1.html#Security">Security</a>].</p>

  corresponding codes from [<a href="../tr41/tr41-1.html#ISO15924">ISO15924</a>] are provided as short names for the scripts.</p>
	<p>In some cases the match between these script values 
    and the ISO 15924 codes is not precise, because the goals are somewhat 
    different. ISO 15924 is aimed primarily at the bibliographic identification 
    of scripts; consequently, it occasionally identifies varieties of scripts 
    that may be useful for book cataloging, but that are not considered 
    distinct scripts in the Unicode Standard. For example, ISO 15924 has 
    separate script codes for the Fraktur and Gaelic varieties of the Latin 
    script.</p>
	<p>Where there are no corresponding ISO 15924 codes, the 
    private-use ones starting with Q are used. Such 
    values are likely to change in the future. In such a case, the Q-names will 
    be retained as aliases in the [<a href="../tr41/tr41-1.html#PropValue">PropValue</a>] 
    for backward compatibility.</p>

	Assignment of Script Values</h3>
	<p>New characters and scripts are continually added to the 
	Unicode Standard. The following methodology is used to assign script values 
	when new characters are added to the Unicode Standard:</p>
	<div class="book-only"><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
	<ol type="A">
		<li>
		If a character is used in only one script, assign it to 
		that script</li>
	<li>Otherwise, nonspacing marks (Mn, Me) and zero width joiner/non-joiner are
	<b>Inherited</b></li>
	<li>Otherwise, use <b>Common</b>
	</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Script values are not immutable. As more data on the usage of 
	individual characters is collected, script values may be reassigned using 
	the above methodology.</p>
	<h3 class="section"><a name="Assignment_Script_Names">3.3</a> New Script Names</h3>
	<p>The following methodology is used to create names for new 
	scripts added to the Unicode Standard. Script names are limited to</p><ol type="A">
	<li>Latin letters A–Z or a–z</li>
		<li>Digits 0–9</li>
		<li><span class="name">SPACE</span> and medial <span class="name">HYPHEN-MINUS</span></li>
  </ol>
	<p>Script names are guaranteed 
	to be unique, even when ignoring case differences and the presence of 
	<span class="name">SPACE</span> 
	or <span class="name">HYPHEN-MINUS</span>. Underscores are not used when assigning script names. 
	Similar restrictions apply to block names.</p>
	<h2 class="section"><a name="Data_File">4</a> Data File</h2>
  <p>The Scripts.txt data file is available at [<a href="../tr41/tr41-1.html#Data24">Data24</a>]. 
  The format of the file is similar to that of Blocks.txt 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-1.html#Blocks">Blocks</a>]. The fields are separated by semicolons. The 
	first field contains either a single code point or the first and last code 
	points in a range separated by “..”. The second field provides the script 
	value for that range. The comment (after a #) indicates the General_Category and the character name. For each range, it gives the character count in square 
  brackets and uses the names for the first and last characters in the range. 
  For example:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>0B01;       ORIYA # Mn ORIYA SIGN CANDRABINDU
0B02..0B03; ORIYA # Mc [2] ORIYA SIGN ANUSVARA..ORIYA SIGN VISARGA</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The value <b>Unknown<!-- Common--></b> is the default value, given to all code points that are 
  not explicitly mentioned in the data file.</p>
