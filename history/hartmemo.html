Subject:           Personal Contribution, Report on Informal Meeting to Discuss
                   10646-Unicode Merger
 
Action Requested:  Information
 
 
    Recently, we held an informal discussion between proponents of ISO-IEC
    DIS 10646 (from JTC1/SC2/WG2) and Unicode (from the Unicode Consortium)
    for the purpose of exploring the possibility of merging the two
    incompatible codes into one code.  We achieved a breakthrough because the
    diverse group achieved consensus on several issues that divided 10646 and
    Unicode.  Although several issues remain to be resolved, and our proposal
    needs to be accepted by the formal organizations involved, it is
    appropriate to share this good news with you.  We ask for your support
    of this effort.
 
                           _________________________
 
 
    Many information users and developers are concerned about the real
possibility that we will need to support two incompatible multi-octet codes, ISO
10646 and Unicode.  Some may say that Unicode is not an international standard
and therefore deserves neither support nor recognition.  However, we live in an
imperfect world where regardless of whether Unicode is an international standard
or not, many of us will have to choose to support it unless we do something
soon.  For the reasons stated in the enclosed document, I believe that the world
is too small to have two incompatible multi-octet codes with the same goal.  I
also believe that both DIS 10646 and Unicode complement each other and have
features valuable to a multi-octet code.  Therefore, an international standard
that merges the best features of DIS 10646 and Unicode makes good sense to me,
and I hope to you also.  That is my goal.
 
    In May, the 10646 Working Group, JTC1/SC2/WG2, met in San Francisco,
California, USA.  This appeared to be the perfect time and place to hold a
discussion between the 10646 proponents and the Unicode proponents.  The results
of such discussions could be extremely useful in resolving issues if the DIS
10646 should fail to obtain a majority of the ballots.  Although we wanted to
hold these discussions at the WG2 meeting, JTC1 rules prevented discussing any
changes to DIS 10646 while it was out for ballot.  Accordingly, we did not
discuss any changes to DIS 10646 at the WG2 meeting.  Rather, after the meeting
ended, we met informally to discuss merging the two codes into one.
 
    I believe that we achieved a breakthrough because we achieved consensus on
several issues that divided 10646 and Unicode.  This was particularly
encouraging because the participants presented a diverse industry cross-section.
We came from eight countries, over a dozen (12) different enterprises, included
both product developers and users, and represented both the 10646 and 
Unicode codes.  If it was a breakthrough that we had the discussions, it was a miracle
to get consensus among such a diverse group.  The initial results are enclosed
for you to read and reach your own conclusions.
 
    While encouraging as a first step, the proposal needs additional work.  When
the proposal to merge DIS 10646 and Unicode is completed, I will submit it to
JTC1/SC2/WG2 for consideration.  Meanwhile, I am making the draft available for
your consideration, your comments, and if you think it appropriate, your
support.
 
 
    Thank you for your consideration.

   This document represents the first draft of what we hope
   will become a proposal to merge DIS 10646 and Unicode into
   one code.  The primary advantage of this proposal is that
   it is built on consensus of people supporting ISO 10646 and
   others supporting Unicode.  We plan to submit a final
   consensus document to WG2 for consideration at the WG2
   editing meeting planned for August, 1991 in Geneva,
   Switzerland.  At that time, we plan to work within WG2 to
   refine the 10646 standard.
 
Summary
 
   We affirm our strong support of the effort by ISO-IEC
JTC1/SC2/WG2 to develop 10646.  We believe that ISO with its open
and responsive procedures will give careful consideration to our
proposal to refine the DIS 10646.  In addition, we believe that
the Unicode Consortium has provided valuable insight and
technical solutions to newer requirements.  We also believe that
having a single international standard that incorporates the best
features of DIS 10646 and Unicode as outlined in this proposal is
far superior to having two incompatible standards with same goal.
 
   Therefore, after the completion of the May, 1991 ISO-IEC
JTC1/SC2/WG2 meeting in San Francisco, California in the USA, the
delegates attended an informal meeting.  At the meeting, we
discussed requirements to merge ISO-IEC DIS 10646 and Unicode.
The people attending the informal meeting included some who
favored the ISO 10646 code and others who favored Unicode.  We
believed that achieving consensus among these people would lead
to a merger proposal more likely to be supported by ISO-IEC
JTC1/SC2 and the Unicode Consortium.
 
   In view of the diverse views represented at the meeting, the
results are surprisingly positive.  We succeeded in reaching a
consensus on major design issues that had previously separated
the DIS 10646 and Unicode codes and made them incompatible.  We
believe that this proposal paves the way for a merger of the best
features of DIS 10646 and Unicode into one multi-octet code
standard.  Yet, this is merely a first step; further work and
consensus are required to produce a final proposal.  In summary,
although ISO and the Unicode Consortium have not yet endorsed
this proposal, it is promising because it was the result of a
consensus of many people who represented both the ISO 10646 and
Unicode Consortium efforts.
 
   However, our work would have been almost impossible had it not
been preceded by the excellent proposals submitted to WG2 by
ECMA, Canada and China.  To form our consensus, we used these
proposals and new information on the Chinese, Japanese and Korean
Joint Research Group (CJK-JRG) announced at the WG2 meeting in
San Francisco.
 
   We believe this new proposal is very promising and those
attending agreed to work to build support for it within their
respective companies, and national and industry standard bodies,
including ECMA and the Unicode Consortium.
 
 
General Objectives
 
   We adopted the following objectives for the group:
 
1.     Create a proposal to merge the best features of DIS 10646
       and Unicode such that the proposal is acceptable to both
       ISO and the Unicode Consortium.
 
2.     Increase cooperation between ISO-IEC JTC1/SC2 and the
       Unicode Consortium.
 
3.     Define action items and the timing to complete them.

Advantages of Having Only One Multi-Octet Code Standard
 
    Here is a list of advantages to having one global multi-octet
code standard:
 
1.    Why should we be concerned about two standards?
 
      a.     Inevitable requirement to support both
             i.    10646 because it is an international standard
             ii.   Unicode for compatibility with Unicode-based
                   products
 
      b.     Cost of supporting both
             i.    The cost to do both is probably very large
             ii.   Must consider the costs to convert between the two
 
      c.     Erosion of %single code standard% mind-set
             i.    If two, why not three? four? ten?
 
      d.     Diminishes advantages of either alone without the
             other
             i.    Single code standard solves many problems that
                   would not be solved if we have two or more of them
             ii.   May introduce the requirement to switch between
                   the two
 
2.    The importance of de-jure standards
 
      a.     Increasingly used as procurement requirements
             i.    Gives customer more options for interconnection of
                   products from different vendors
 
      b.     Integral part of vast, interlocking family of
             standards, each assuming the others
 
      c.     Better acceptance, because every country can
             participate
             i.    Not perceived as dominated by U.S.
 
3.    Problems of code conversion
 
      a.     Must identify both the source and the target code, but
             often no way to do this
 
      b.     Conversion is application/subsystem dependent, and it
             often cannot be confined to one place (that is, it is
             much more expensive)
 
      c.     Solving same problem in several places introduces
             probability of getting some solutions out of
             synchronization with others
 
      d.     An uncontrollable, moving target (that is, you never
             own more than one of the two codes, you cannot control
             repertoires, etc.)
 
      e.     Complicated by repertoire differences
 
      f.     No %right% way to manage the differences
             i.    Mismatch can range from minor irritation to
                   catastrophe
 
      g.     Further complicated by differences in character
             semantics
             i.    No tested solution is known
             ii.   At best, makes translation even more difficult
 
4.    The Costs of code conversion
 
      a.     Monetary cost of developing, testing, maintaining,
             etc.
      b.     Diversion of human and other resources by developers
      c.     Performance and memory penalties (extra overhead)
      d.     Errors and other problems are inevitable
      e.     Customer dissatisfaction
      f.     Customer conversion requirements will divert resources
             for creating local solutions
      g.     Forces tradeoffs between satisfying installed base and
             meeting new market requirements
 
5.    Other advantages
 
      a.     One reference source for the code
 
 
Areas of Consensus
 
1.    Remove the %C0%and %C1% restrictions.
 
      We support the ECMA proposal, point 1, %To remove the
      restriction on the so-called C1 space.%  This point is also
      included in the Canadian proposal, and other national body
      positions on DIS 10646 including the ones from China and the
      US.
      Vote Thursday:  17 for/ 0 against/ 2 abstain (Davis,
      Freytag)
 
      In addition, pending a careful review by computer
      communication, systems, and applications experts, from ISO,
      ECMA, CCITT, and within our enterprises, we believe it
      desirable to allow encoding graphic characters in the %C0%
      space presently reserved in DIS 10646.  This refines point 2
      from the Canadian proposal.  Annex ____ provides more
      details on this refinement (the %Bohn% refinement, named for
      Willy Bohn, who proposed it) of the ECMA proposal.
      Vote Thursday:  16 for/ 0 against/ 3 abstain (Bishop,
      Hasegawa, Sato)
 
      Removing the %C0% restriction in addition to removing the
      %C1% restriction will provide for flexibility by allowing
      the encoding of more characters in the base multilingual
      plane that is the most important 2-octet plane for
      interchange and interworking.  A consequence of removing the
      %C0% restriction is that 10646 must change the way 1-octet
      control characters are encoded by placing the 1-octet
      control character into the least significant octet of the
      current compaction method and padding the most significant
      octets to the width of the current compaction method.  In
      addition, the 1-octet compaction method must be adjusted to
      ensure that the control characters are correctly handled.
 
2.    Create an International Repertoire of Unified Chinese,
      Japanese, and Korean Ideographs and Encode This Set of
      Ideographs into the Base Multilingual Plane.
 
      We propose a refinement to point 5 of the Canadian proposal.
      We believe that coding an international repertoire of
      unified Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ideographs in the base
      multilingual plane is mandatory for international
      interworking and processing efficiency.  The encoding of the
      international C/J/K repertoire must be completed by the end
      of 1991.  We propose to use the CJK-JRG results if it is
      available in 1991; otherwise we propose to use the best
      information available at that time.
      Vote Thursday:  17 for/ 0 against/ 1 abstain (Ksar), 1
      absent (Hasegawa)
 
      Recent statements by the Japanese delegates to WG2 showed
      their strong support for the CJK-JRG.  From this
      information, the group concluded that the unification of
      Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ideographs so highly desired
      by the international community is feasible.  Providing that
      WG2 continues to recognize the stated Japanese requirement
      to encode its characters in its own 10646 plane, Japan
      recognized the need for an international repertoire of
      Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ideographs.  A meeting of the
      CJK-JRG has been called (Tokyo, July, 1991) to start
      creating an international repertoire and ordering.
 
3.    Allow the Option to Use Non-Spacing Marks.
 
      Pending careful review by ISO TC46 and CCITT, we propose to
      refine point iv) 2) of the ECMA proposal for floating
      diacritical marks as follows:  The third Code Extension
      Level should specify:
 
      a.     In addition to diacritics, non-spacing marks should
             include stress marks, tone marks, and those used for
             text processing operations such as underlining or
             mathematical notation for the name of a vector.
      b.     Non-spacing marks should follow the base character for
             consistency.
      c.     Imaging and the order of multiple non-spacing
             diacritics should follow well-defined rules.  (See
             Annex ____.)
      d.     To allow for compliance with future versions of 10646
             that may encode additional pre-composed characters,
             allow both encoding a character as a pre-composed
             character or as a base character with one or more non-
             spacing marks.  (That is, delete the ECMA statement
             %if the accented letter is already coded as a single
             character, the alternative representation by means of
             floating diacritical marks is not allowed.%)  This
             assumes that future revisions of 10646 will take
             certain characters that used floating marks in the
             current version of 10646 and encode them as pre-
             composed characters.
      e.     All sequences of codes should be allowed because of
             the difficulty of enforcing a legislation against
             certain sequences of code positions.
 
      Vote Thursday:  16 for/ 0 against/ 1 abstain (Sato)/ absent
      (Bohn, Hasegawa, Ksar)
 
4.    Define the merger (10646M) of DIS 10646 and Unicode as a 4-
      octet code.
      Vote Thursday:  16 for/ 0 against/ 0 abstain/ absent
      (Hasegawa, Ksar, Bohn)
 
      We support the 4-octet definition of the merger of DIS 10646
      and Unicode.  Using 4-octets allows the flexibility needed
      to expand the code repertoire to meet all foreseeable
      requirements.
 
5.    Location of Space for Presentation Forms
 
      We would support a drastic reduction or elimination of the
      presentation forms in the base multilingual plane while
      retaining codes necessary to transcode existing standards in
      plain text.  People were concerned that DIS 10646 reserved
      too much unused code space in the base multilingual plane.
      A final determination of the presentation codes will be made
      in consultation with Arabic and other experts.
      Vote Thursday:  15 for/ 0 against/ 1 abstain (Becker)
 
6.    Combine the Repertoires of DIS 10646 and Unicode into the
      Merged Code.
 
      We propose that the repertoire of the base multilingual
      plane of the merged code, 10646M, be derived from a superset
      composed of the union of the repertoires of DIS 10646 and
      Unicode; for example, the superset should include pre-
      composed Latin, Greek, Hangul, Vietnamese, and additional
      symbols.
      Vote Friday:  10 for/ 0 against/ 0 abstain
 
7.    Simplify the Compaction Methods.
 
      We are concerned about the complexity of the DIS 10646
      compaction forms.  For simplicity, we propose that there be
      several parts to the standard:
 
      Part 1:      General introduction, terminology, etc.
 
      Part 2:      The base multilingual plane (BMP).  This part of
                   the standard will specify the 2-octet
                   implementation of the BMP.  Other parts are not
                   required for conforming implementations of the
                   BMP.  This part may be implemented without
                   announcers.
 
      Part 3:      The full four-octet canonical form.
 
      Part 4:      Mechanisms for other compaction methods to be
                   determined.
 
      In the absence of other introducers for 10646 data, Part 2
      should be assumed.
 
      Vote Friday:  10 for/ 0 against/ 0 abstain
 
8.    Make Annex H Part of the 10646 Conformance statement.
 
      We recommend moving Annex H of DIS 10646 into the main body
      of the standard and making it a requirement for conformance.
      Vote Friday:  9 for/ 0 against/ 0 abstain/ 1 absent (Bohn)
 
Due to time limitations we were unable to discuss and make
recommendations to resolve the following differences between DIS
10646 and Unicode.
 
9.    Coding of Semantics versus Shape.
 
      For example, parenthesis, brackets and braces are coded as
      open/close in Unicode, and as left/right in DIS 10646.
 
10.   Using Any Multi-Octet Coded-Character-Set Will Require
      Program Changes.
 
      The following two examples show that neither DIS 10646 nor
      Unicode may be blindly used with the C programming language.
 
      a.     C Language Wide-Character (wchar_t) Model
 
      Padding ISO 8859/1 characters with the decimal 032 value
      precludes the direct use (without conversion) of 10646
      compaction forms 2-4 as the wchar_t data type in the C
      programming language.  This is point 3 in the Canadian
      position statement.
 
      b.     NULL Characters in the C Language
 
      Unicode may use 000 as the first or second octet of the 2-
      octet code.  The C language uses the NULL (000) octet as a
      character string terminator for 1-octet character data.
      Therefore, C programs must be rewritten to use Unicode.
 
11.   Other Issues
 
      The above list of differences between Unicode and DIS 10646
      is not exhaustive.  Other lower priority issues also need to
      be considered.
 
 
 
Action Items to Promote the Agreement
 
1.    Participants will lobby for this proposal with their country
      and company constituencies. (All, immediately)
 
2.    Ask the Unicode Consortium member companies to place a
      discussion of this document on the agenda of the next
      Unicode Consortium meeting on June 7.  The Unicode 
      Consortium should formally state that it agrees or disagrees
      with the general direction and state any of its concerns
      with specific points. (Whistler)
 
3.    Form a joint editing committee to help draft the final 10646
      merged standard. (Freytag provides updated code tables,
      Hasegawa provides updated structure and text, 15 Aug. list
      the areas of the DIS 10646 document that would require
      changes)
 
4.    For closer cooperation between ISO and the Unicode
      Consortium, we encourage the Unicode Consortium to pursue
      becoming a liaison member of JTC1/SC2, and for JTC1/SC2 to
      accept the Consortium as a liaison member. (Unicode
      Consortium, Aug., 1991)
 
5.    Send this report to the national bodies and ask them to
      consider our consensus agreement in their votes on ISO-IEC
      DIS 10646.  (Hart, 29 May)
 
6.    Provide a list of the advantages of having one multi-octet
      code rather than two. (Andersen, done)
 
7.    (Point 1) Coordinate an investigation of the impact of
      coding in C0. (Scheinberg, 15 Aug.)
 
8.    (Point 2) Using formal minutes and other information,
      summarize the Tokyo CJK-JRG meeting. (Collins, 31 July)
 
9.    (Point 3) Provide the Annex describing the rules to be used
      with multiple non-spacing marks. (Whistler, 9 June)
 
10.   (Point 3) Coordinate review by ISO TC46 and CCITT of
      proposed use of non-spacing marks. (Smith-Yoshimura (TC46)
      and Friemelt (CCITT), Aug. 15)
 
11.   (Point 5) Coordinate a review of the need to reserve so
      large an area for presentation forms for Arabic and other
      scripts on the base multilingual plane. (Ksar and Friemelt,
      15 Aug.).
 
12.   (Point 6) Investigate need for composed characters from
      Cyrillic and Polytonic Greek. (Why did WG2 include them in
      the DIS?) (Whistler, 15 Aug.)
 
13.   (Point 7) Coordinate an investigation of which compaction
      methods to propose in %Part 4%. (Jarnefors, 15 Aug.)
 
14.   Create 10646M electronic distribution list.  Send electronic
      mail message to Hart [** see below] to subscribe.  (Hart, done)
