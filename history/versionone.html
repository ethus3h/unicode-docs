        <h1>Chronology of Unicode Version 1.0</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><b>1986-1987 </b></p>
          <p>At Xerox, Huan-mei Liao, Nelson Ng, Dave Opstad, and Lee Collins 
          begin work on a database to map the relationships between identical 
          Japanese (JIS) and Chinese (simplified and traditional) characters for 
          quickly building a font for extended Chinese characters. Xerox users 
          (e.g. Nakajima of Toronto) were in fact using JIS to extend the small 
          Chinese character set. This leads to a first discussion of Han 
          Unification, the pros &amp; cons of which are written up by Eric Mader.</p>
          <p>At the same time at Apple, discussions of a universal character set&nbsp; 
          are sparked by the Apple File Exchange development. Mark Davis begins 
          Apple&#39;s participation in ANSI X3L2.</p>
          <p><b>April 1987</b></p>
          <p>Peter Fenwick&#39;s visit to Xerox inspires Unicode&#39;s original &quot;begin 
          at 0 and add the next character&quot; architecture. Also attending were 
          Alan Tucker and Karen Smith-Yoshimura from RLG (The Research Libraries 
          Group) and Nakajima from the University of Toronto.</p>
          <p><b>Fall 1987</b></p>
          <p>The Xerox group under Joe Becker begins discussing multilingual 
          issues with Davis. New character encoding is a major topic.</p>
          <p>Evaluation by Opstad that 7 years of experience with Xerox XCCS 
          compression scheme shows that fixed-width design is preferable.</p>
          <p><b>December 1987</b></p>
          <p>Earliest documented use of the term &quot;Unicode&quot; coined by Becker; 
          from unique, universal, and uniform character encoding.</p>
          <p><b>February 1988</b></p>
          <p>Collins begins work at Apple. One of the first tasks is to consider 
          Davis&#39;s new character encoding proposals for future Apple systems, one 
          of which includes fixed-width 16 bit characters, under the name &quot;High 
          Text&quot; (ASCII being &quot;Low Text&quot;). Three main investigations are 
          completed:</p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>comparisons of fixed-width and mixed-width text access;</li>
            <li>investigations of the total system storage requirements with 
            two-byte text; and </li>
            <li>preliminary character counts for all world alphabets.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Based on these investigations, and experience with different 
          character encodings, the basic architecture for Unicode is derived. 
          This is incorporated in Collins&#39; document Unicode Principles.</p>
          <p>Becker presents Unicode principles to /usr/group 
          Internationalization Subcommittee meeting at Uniforum in Dallas.</p>
          <p><b>April 1988</b></p>
          <p>First Unicode text prototypes begin in Apple. Decision is made to 
          incorporate Unicode support into TrueType.</p>
          <p><b>Summer 1988</b></p>
          <p>Becker and Collins meet with Tucker and Smith-Yoshimura of RLG in 
          the downtown Palo Alto RLG annex to discuss criteria for unifying Han 
          characters.</p>
          <p><b>July 1988</b></p>
          <p>Apple purchases RLG&#39;s CJK character database for study of Han 
          Unification.</p>
          <p><b>September 1988</b></p>
          <p>Becker and Collins go to ANSI X3L2 to argue for Han Unification and 
          use of C0 C1 within ISO DP 10646. Becker later presents &quot;Unicode &#39;88&quot; 
          proposal to ISO WG2.</p>
          <p><b>October 1988</b></p>
          <p>Encouraged by Ed Smura of Association of Font Information 
          Interchange (AFII), Collins and Becker attend AFII meeting in Tokyo to 
          discuss Han glyphs. Included demo at Fuji Xerox of the Xerox Han 
          cross-reference tool in reference to Han unification.</p>
          <p><b>November 1988</b></p>
          <p>Collins begins building the Unicode Non-Han database and defining 
          the initial repertoire, the first database for the Unicode names and 
          mappings. The core content and issues are refined in a series of 
          meetings. The original design, based on distinction between text 
          content and text form, excludes composite characters.</p>
          <p><b>January 1989</b></p>
          <p>Collins meets with Xerox standards people (Ed Smura, Abhay Busha, 
          Becker) to discuss sharing of databases for Han Unification. Xerox 
          supports multi-corporate alternative to 10646. Agrees to exchange data 
          with the aim of harmonizing the two databases.</p>
          <p>Metaphor decides to implement a 16-bit character encoding to 
          support internationalization of its software.</p>
          <p><b>February 1989</b></p>
          <p>Unicode meeting brings in Metaphor (Mike Kernaghan and Ken 
          Whistler), RLG (Karen Smith-Yoshimura and Joan Aliprand).</p>
          <p>Out of this grows the bi-monthly meetings joined by Sun (Glenn 
          Wright), then Adobe (John Renner), Claris (Joe Bosurgi), HP (Mike Ksar), 
          NeXT (James Higa) and Pacific Rim Connections (James Caldwell).</p>
          <p>The numbering of these Unicode working group meetings, which later 
          morphed into Unicode Technical Committee meetings when the Unicode 
          Consortium was formally founded in 1991, starts from the February 1989 
          meeting.</p>
          <p>Meetings are initially held at Xerox, Metaphor, Apple, and HP. 
          Eventually RLG offers a permanent meeting place.</p>
          <p>Glenn Wright begins maintaining Unicode@sun.com for network 
          discussion of Unicode.</p>
          <p><b>March 1989</b></p>
          <p>Collins begins building Unicode Han database in Hypercard using RLG 
          and CCCII data. Repertoire of existing Han standards (Big Five/CNS, 
          GB, JIS, KS, and EACC) is completed by May.</p>
          <p><b>April 1989</b></p>
          <p>Decision to incorporate all composite characters in existing ISO 
          registered standards and to guarantee round trip conversion to 
          existing standards.</p>
          <p><b>May 1989</b></p>
          <p>Becker and Collins attend AFII meeting in Hong Kong to discuss 
          common Han glyphs. AFII comes out in support of Han Unification within 
          ISO DP 10646.</p>
          <p><b>August 1989</b></p>
          <p>Becker and Collins merge Apple and Xerox Han databases, resolving 
          differences. Decision to follow JIS and Chinese guidelines in 
          resolving variants and to preserve all distinctions within existing 
          standards.</p>
          <p>Decision to use logical ordering for bidirectional (Middle Eastern) 
          and Indic text. Issues of multiple embeddings first discussed.</p>
          <p><b>September 1989</b></p>
          <p>Becker and Collins present first draft (printed by Becker) of 
          Unicode to ANSI X3L2. As a result, ANSI proposes a compromised Han 
          Unification and use of C0, C1 to ISO. Apple, Claris, Metaphor, NeXT, 
          and Sun participate on behalf of Unicode. This first draft uses 
          Davis&#39;s Gray code scheme for ordering the Han.</p>
          <p>As a result of this compromise, the Unicode working group decides 
          to use existing ISO orderings for script subsets, and use the ISO 
          naming schemes.</p>
          <p><b>October 1989</b></p>
          <p>Collins presents Unicode to Microsoft and IBM in conjunction with 
          cooperation between Apple and Microsoft on TrueType.</p>
          <p>Collins attends ISO Ad Hoc on Han Unification in Beijing, 
          representing both ANSI and Unicode. Input from this meeting encourages 
          use of human-readable ordering of the Han characters. Unicode resolves 
          to cooperate with China on Han unification.</p>
          <p>Collins discussed Unicode with Apple Japan engineers and gets 
          support for Unicode.</p>
          <p>Davis represents Unicode at ISO SC2/WG2 meeting in Amman Jordan. 
          WG2 agrees to accept floating diacritics.</p>
          <p>Rick McGowan of AT&amp;T Unix Pacific in Tokyo begins vigorous 
          discussion in support of Unicode on unicode@sun.com.</p>
          <p><b>November 1989</b></p>
          <p>Cora Zhang is hired to begin identifying JIS X 0212-1990 and GB1 
          mappings for inclusion in Unicode Han set.</p>
          <p><b>December 1989</b></p>

          TrueType font Jamboree.</p>
          <p>Becker presents Unicode at Unix Internationalization meeting.</p>
          <p><b>January 1990</b></p>
          <p>As a result of Apple-Microsoft&nbsp; cooperation on True-Type, 
          Microsoft begins to show interest in Unicode. Michel Suignard and 
          Asmus Freytag of Microsoft begin attending Unicode meetings.</p>
          <p>McGowan later attends first Unicode meeting in Tokyo with Apple 
          Japan, Microsoft KK, etc.</p>
          <p>JIS committee meets to discuss Unicode. Collins translates comments 
          from Pro Tajima resulting from this meeting. Becker and Collins write 
          responses.</p>
          <p>Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing highlights Unicode project as 
          part of discussion on fonts. Becker, Collins and Davis respond with 
          two lengthy corrections in April issue.</p>
          <p><b>March 1990</b></p>
          <p>Collins and Becker attend the ISO WG2 Ad Hoc on Han Unification in 
          Seoul Korea. New layout of Unicode is distributed based on Kang Xi 
          radical stroke order.</p>
          <p>Non-Han basically is completed by this time. Work begins on cross 
          mappings and names.</p>
          <p>Characters are removed from&nbsp; 0x0080-0x009F C1 space for 
          compatibility. &quot;Roundtrip&quot; guaranteed for ISO 8859 and ISO 6937.</p>
