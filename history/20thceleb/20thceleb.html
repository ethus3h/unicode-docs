          <p><font size="3">It's been twenty years since Joe Becker, the father of Unicode, published 
			<a href="../unicode88.pdf">Unicode 88</a> while working for Xerox in Palo Alto, CA.
          To celebrate this milestone, the Unicode Consortium held a trivia and poetry contest during the 32nd Internationalization and Unicode 
          Conference reception on September 10, 2008. These pages are an attempt to share this celebration with those of you who missed 
          our latest conference and to thank all the Unicode fans who contributed to make this evening a real success.</font></p>

									Here's to Unicode, that internationalization panacea,<br>
					Let's hope that we'll never find need to replace ya!<br>
					Your uniformity, uniqueness, and most of all, universality<br>
					Make up your (ten) principled character personality.<br>
					<br>
					On round trips you're compatible with the most obscure 
					graphemes<br>
					Forcing them into normalcy, then encoding schemes.<br>
					With the patience of saints, it is no surprise<br>
					You have an RFC role to canonicalize.<br>
					<br>
					You bring characters together in dynamic combinations<br>
					Assisting programs in correct interpretation<br>
					(But never insisting on specific presentations,<br>
					Instead leaving that to experts in localization.)<br>
					<br>
					Shall I extol your streamlined Basic Multilingual Plane<br>
					Even as it goes beyond FFFF again and again? <br>
					About your capacity I can&#39;t be too complimentary<br>
					I mean, over a million possible characters supplementary!<br>
					<br>
					All the world&#39;s modern and ancient scripts are included<br>
					(Though Klingon is one the committee eluded;<br>
					But still there&#39;s no need to resort to hysteria,<br>
					For one is equipped with a Private Use Area.)<br>
					<br>
					Each character, too, has a property selection<br>
					Such as function and case, position and direction.<br>
					Bi-directionality I mean, the right-to-left, left-to-right 
					one,<br>
					Not something as complex as boustrophedon.<br>
					<br>
					Your versatility knows not a boundary;<br>
					Many character encodings have emerged from your foundry.<br>
					There are 8-, 16-, and 32-bit selections.<br>
					(The 7-bit was &nbsp;deprecated for everyone&#39;s protection.)<br>
					Though, due to certain platform vending and<br>
					Other factors, 16-bit is endian.<br>
					<br>
					But Unicode, don&#39;t let this praise make you haughty,<br>
					For over the years you too have been naughty!<br>
					In case you&#39;ve forgotten, the Korean move,<br>
					European currency symbol, and a few others prove<br>
					You&#39;re not without fault; but these foibles don&#39;t mask the<br>
					Incredible improvement over US-ASCII.<br>
					<br>
					So here&#39;s to Unicode, and to Joe, Mark, and Lee,<br>
					For all their hard work and a very low fee.<br>
					This repertoire extraordinaire has made its place.<br>
					After all, where else could one find a zero-width no-break 
					space?

					<p>
					It's a Farsi email from the Polish 
					punk band, <br>
					To California from their tour in Iceland,<br>
					If your app&#39;s just ASCII, don&#39;t even bother.<br>
					That only works for A to Z.<br>
					<br>
					You could apply every one-byte code page,<br>
					From EBCDIC to Cyrillic Language.<br>
					Big 5 and shift-JIS or eight-eight-five-nine.<br>
					But it won&#39;t encode for you or me.<br>
					<br>
					We need a system that&#39;s universal,<br>
					To send Fulani to Sudan and Nepal,<br>
					To both Koreas, Malta, and Thailand.<br>
					Unicode&#39;s the right technology.<br>
					<br>
					My email&#39;s left hand, your text is right hand.<br>
					Arabic and Hebrew can make your mind bend,<br>
					While you&#39;re building layout routines for BiDi.<br>
					Try I-C-U; the code is free. <br>
					&nbsp;<br>
					So write your web site in Greek or Kanji,<br>
					And online chat with mom in Swahili,<br>
					And maybe someday, even in Emoji.<br>
					Unicode works great for “zou” and “phi”.<br>
					<br>
					As you blog out on that ribbon of type, hey,<br>
					It&#39;s on the worldwide electronic highway,<br>
					In Unicode, it will take the fast lane.<br>
					Your rant is there for all to see.<br>
					<br>
					Sure, it&#39;s missing Klingon and obscure dead sprache,<br>
					But it sorts R-S-S feeds straight from Pravda.<br>
					And your Chinese thesis will look great in Finland.<br>
					Millions can read just what you mean.<br>
					<br>
					If it seems too complex, and you think you should wait,<br>
					Don&#39;t forget that Java speaks UTF-8,<br>
					And other platforms use the I-C-U libs.<br>
					Open Source software is the key.<br>
					<br>
					Don&#39;t build your app with just an English GUI,<br>
					Next week your boss will want it all in Hindi,<br>
					I-18-N and L-10-N save you.<br>
					Each new locale will be a breeze.<br>
					<br>
					This text is yours and this text is mine, and<br>
					They'll read it all on dial-up and broadband.<br>
					A hundred thousand code points, and growing.<br>
					This standard's made for you and me.<br>
