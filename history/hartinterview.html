          <h1>The ISO / Unicode Merger</h1>
          <h2 align="center">An Interview with Ed Hart *</h2>
          <p align="center"><i><font size="2">Conducted by Laura Wideburg ** on 
          October 16, 1995</font></i></p>
          <h2></h2>
          <p>“I worked on a position paper for Share Inc. We were working on 
          ASCII and EBCDIC. The IBM version had 95 characters, 3 were not in 
          ASCII and vice versa. There were problems just converting between 
          these two sets. At that time there was 7-bit ISO 646, and they were 
          all country specific. There were 3 different versions for Switzerland.</p>
          <p>In 1991 you had ISO 10646 and Unicode 1.0. Both codes wanted to be 
          the one code. They were also incompatible, so the translation between 
          the codes would be impossible. For instance, you had the floating 
          diacritics in Unified CJK. There were different ways of encoding, and 
          so round-trip integrity was in question. Both 10646 and Unicode were 
          going full bore. Several companies were already going Unicode. 
          Governments were deciding which standard to choose as their standard. 
          I realized that two standards may exist and there’d be attempts to 
          make round-trip conversion. Our main concern in SHARE was round-trip 
          integrity. We had all these problems in the US with just 6 characters. 
          What kind of problems would you have with 65 000? I termed it a 
          disaster and got people’s attention.</p>
          <p>In September 1990, I got a call from Isai [Isai Scheinberg, IBM&#39;s 
          representative to Unicode]. He asked, “What are we going to do about 
          it? How is SHARE going to vote on the [10646-DIS 1] ballot?” </p>
          <p>I knew there were good reasons for choosing Unicode, but also good 
          reasons for choosing ISO. I really didn’t know which one would be 
          better.</p>
          <p>One of the SHARE members called me. “This isn’t an academic 
          question. It will take millions of dollars to install. The conversion 
          is expensive, the storage is expensive, and the memory is expensive.” 
          Multi-byte code was just not academic.</p>
          <p>So we went out to the SHARE membership. Isai and Monty [???] sent 
          out a survey about the two codes. Do you need a standard? Which one 
          would you choose? Or both? Or a combination of the two?”</p>
          <p>We had Mike Ksar, Masami Hasegawa [Editor of 10646], Lee Collins 
          [Unicode&#39;s Han-Unification Expert] and Ken Whistler describe the 
          differences.</p>
          <p>We had 13% participation in the survey. We had 260,000 members, 
          many Fortune 500 companies. Many people didn’t vote because they felt 
          they didn’t know enough about the technical issues. But one thing was 
          clear. They wanted just one standard.</p>
          <p>We wrote a summary paper with bar charts, and we sent it to ISO and 
          probably to Unicode as well.</p>
          <p>In May, ISO [JTC1/SC2/WG2] was going to meet in San Francisco. This 
          was the perfect spot to discuss a merger. I brought it up to Jerry 
          Andersen. Mike Ksar had just been elected convener of the ISO group 
          and was concerned about doing his job correctly. Jerry and I talked 
          about the merger every week. I wanted to go for the merger at ISO, but 
          Mike said as soon as ISO was over, we could use the H-P facilities 
          afterwards, and “Ed, why don’t you lead the discussion?”</p>
          <p>It was like trying to get the Hatfields and McCoys together. I 
          prayed about it, I can tell you. I talked to my manager about it. We 
          realized that we couldn’t even begin to talk about a merger until 
          there was trust created between the two parties. We had to build the 
          trust, even while appearing to make progress on the technical issues.</p>
          <p>Jerry made an announcement, and put the merger on the table. My 
          goal was to pull it together. I was neutral, I didn’t care whether it 
          was Unicode or ISO and that gave me some advantage.</p>
          <p>First, I went out just with Unicode. I meet Lee, Joe and Isai. I’m 
          not sure I met Mark then, but maybe not until the actual meeting.</p>
          <p>The next night, I went out with Mike, Jerry and Hasegawa.</p>
          <p>Both groups said the same thing: “We don’t trust ‘em.”</p>
          <p>At IBM, we had people in both camps, and the IBM corporate 
          direction had to be set. If we pulled off the merger, IBM would buy 
          it.</p>
          <p>The ISO meeting broke up on Wednesday morning. On Wednesday 
          afternoon, I started with some trust building exercises. I only 
          allowed one person to speak at a time. First we had a spokesperson 
          describe: “Why we did it this way”. Ken spoke for Unicode, Jerry for 
          ISO. Really, 10646 was more big-frame, and Unicode was more 
          workstation. A big issue was how wide the code was. ISO said, 8, 16, 
          24 or 32. Unicode said 16, period. We got over that one.</p>
          <p>We went back and forth and I said, “Give me an advantage from the 
          other person’s scheme.” So this way, they better understood each other 
          technically and each side gained credibility.</p>
          <p>At one in the afternoon on Thursday, I said, “It’s time to talk 
          about a merger.” I asked questions, “What is the shape of 16-bit? Are 
          you going to reserve space for control characters? How many characters 
          are you going to include?” The number of characters would determine 
          how big a player Unicode was going to be.</p>
          <p>Willy Bohn from IBM in Germany said, “So, why don’t we just go with 
          65 000 characters?” Another ISO guy said, “Do you know what you just 
          said?”</p>
          <p>Isai volunteered to investigate control characters, and we had 
          about 5 other issues.</p>
          <p>On Friday, Jaing said, “You’ll have this for me tomorrow.” I spent 
          the night until 3 a.m. finishing the minutes!</p>
          <p>At that meeting, we (one) built trust (two) respected each other 
          and (three) had agreement on five issues.</p>
          <p>We published the minutes and had them distributed. So many 
          countries voted asking for a merger. Now how to handle this merger?</p>
          <p>Europe would be a real mess. Their idea was, “They have just a 
          bunch of independent cowboys out there.” Avery [Bishop] called me. “We 
          don’t have a snowball’s chance in hell.” I said, “If we don’t try, 
          we’ll have even less of a chance.”</p>
          <p>In the end, it was a success. There was a real incentive to have 
          just one code. Really, it was a common sense thing. Once people put 
          aside their egos and realized the other side also had reasonable 
          people, it went fine. We had a rational, professional discussion. I 
          remember Mark was at those meetings.</p>
          <p>Now how are we going to get ISO to ratify it in Geneva? Could we 
          keep the same feeling we had in San Francisco? There were lots of 
          people in Europe who didn’t like Unicode. We had an ad hoc meeting in 
          the morning, and people continued to respect what the other side had 
          to say. There were lots of informal discussions over coffee. Mark was 
          calm and deliberate and respectful, and I think that that had a lot to 
          do with Unicode’s acceptance. If he’d been smart-alecky, it would have 
          failed. The way he came across, the Europeans just had to respect him.</p>
          <p>So we worked through several issues. Masami brought in some 
          documents which had already accounted for a merger, and he got some 
          flack for that. So I don’t think that they were distributed as 
          documents.</p>
          <p>After the October meeting in Paris, we had a working group meeting 
          under subcommittee 2 (SC2). WG2 was worried about technical issues. 
          One of our goals was to produce a draft for the ballot. We resolved 
          the comments and went to the next level.</p>
          <p>In Paris, there were no showstoppers, and we got approval for the 
          merger. Meanwhile, Unicode published their book, and in the book they 
          mentioned they were discussing a merger with ISO 10646.</p>
          <p>Eventually we had the merger. Unicode 1.1 and ISO were conformed.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As for my role, I saw myself more as a facilitator, getting the 
          merger started. People realized that they could come to an agreement. 
          I remember the first time they came to an agreement, and I took a 
          break and I said, “Yes!” </p>
          <p>If the people hadn’t been willing to come together, it never would 
          have happened. And like I said, I did A LOT of praying. <br>

          customers, to the US L2 technical standards committee for codes and 
          character sets. There he served as the vice-chairman and later the 
          chairman. While vice- chairman, in 1991 he facilitated the first 
          discussion between the Unicode Consortium and ISO, and represented the 
          US at subsequent discussions. These talks led to an agreement to merge 
          ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode. Since 1994, he has represented SHARE Inc. 
          to the Unicode Technical Committee. Mr. Hart was co-editor of the ISO 
          Technical Report, ISO/IEC TR 15285, &quot;An operational model for 
          characters and glyphs&quot; on which this presentation is based. </p>
