          <h1>Summary Narrative</h1>
          <p align="justify">The Unicode character encoding derives its name 
          from three main goals:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
            <p align="justify">universal (addressing the needs of world 
            languages)</li>
            <li>
            <p align="justify">uniform (fixed-width codes for efficient access), 
            and</li>
            <li>
            <p align="justify">unique (bit sequence has only one interpretation 
            into character codes)</li>
          </ul>
          <p align="justify">The concept of a 16-bit universal code is not new; 
          even the original principles of the ISO multi-byte character encoding 
          are directed to that end:</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;...Develop the ISO standard for graphic character 
          repertoire and coding for an international two byte graphic character 
          set... Consider the needs of programming languages to have the same 
          amount of storage for each character...&quot;</p>
          <p align="justify">[ISO/TC97/SC2 N1436, 1984]</p>
          <p align="justify">Other antecedents to Unicode are found in the Star 
          workstation introduced by Xerox in 1980 and in aspects of the two-byte 
          standards found in the Far East.</p>
          <p align="justify">Unicode began as a project in late 1987 after 
          discussions between engineers from Apple and Xerox: Joe&nbsp; Becker, 
          Lee Collins and Mark Davis. By early 1988, three main investigations 
          had been completed:</p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
            <p align="justify">comparisons of fixed-width and mixed-width text 
            access</li>
            <li>
            <p align="justify">investigations of the total system storage 
            requirements with two-byte text; and</li>
            <li>
            <p align="justify">preliminary character counts for all world 
            alphabets.</li>
          </ol>
          <p align="justify">Based on these investigations, and their experience 
          with different character encodings, Becker, Collins and Davis derived 
          the basic architecture for Unicode.</p>
          <p align="justify">In the fall of 1988, Collins began building a 
          database of Unicode characters.</p>
          <p align="justify">The original design ordered characters 
          alphabetically within scripts, and excluded all composite characters. 
          Xerox had already built up a database of Unified Han for font 
          construction. Collins used a database of EACC characters from RLG (The 
          Research Libraries Group) to start a Han Unification database at 
          Apple. Becker and Collins later correlated the two databases, and 
          Collins continued to extend the database with further character 
          correspondences added for other national standards.</p>
          <p align="justify">In early 1989, the scope of the Unicode working 
          group was extended to gain the participation of other companies. At 
          this time, Ken Whistler and Mike Kernaghan of Metaphor, Karen 
          Smith-Yoshimura and Joan Aliprand of RLG, and Glenn Wright of Sun 
          joined the working group, and began making significant contributions 
          to the design.</p>
          <p align="justify">In mid 1989, a number of changes were made to bring 
          Unicode closer to existing standards. All existing ISO composite 
          characters were added to Unicode, and &quot;round trips&quot; were added (any 
          entries distinguished as two characters in national standards would be 
          distinguished in Unicode), and the ordering was changed to use ISO 
          8859 ordering where possible.</p>
          <p align="justify">In early 1990, Michel Suignard and Asmus Freytag 
          joined representing Microsoft. Together with Whistler, they were to 
          begin an extensive effort to produce mapping tables to other character 
          encoding standards. Unicode alphabetics and symbols were essentially 
          complete by the spring of 1990, but the cross-mapping effort 
          continued. This extensive mapping effort to 10646, IBM, Mac and 
          national standards proved to be an invaluable aid to producing a 
          complete, valid encoding.</p>
          <p align="justify">Joan Winters started representing SHARE at Unicode 
          meetings. Isai Scheinberg and J.G. Van Stee of IBM joined in mid 1990. 
          An extensive IBM review and study was organized at Toronto University. 
          The results of this review include the compatibility zone for 
          half-width characters and Arabic glyphs. James Caldwell of Pacific Rim 
          began working as the editor, pulling together the different documents 
          into a coherent standard document. Most of the character descriptions 
          were completed at this time.</p>
          <p align="justify">By October 1990 the Han characters were also in 
          final draft. The decision was made to have a broad distribution of a 
          final review draft of Unicode, to allow the working group the 
          opportunity to assess and incorporate feedback from a variety of 
          sources. Microsoft and Aldus volunteered to bear the distribution 
          cost. Rick McGowan of NeXT began a database of characters for addition 
          to future versions of the standard.</p>
          <p align="justify">Mike Kernaghan, Bill English, Mark Davis and Asmus 
          Freytag organized most of the business aspects of Unicode, Inc. which 
          was incorporated on Jan 3, 1991 in the state of California.</p>
          <p align="justify">The original purpose of the Unicode Consortium was 
          to &#39;standardize, extend and promote the Unicode character encoding, a 
          fixed-width, 16-bit character encoding for over 60,000 graphic 
          characters.&#39; The statement of purpose has since been updated to 
          reflect that the Unicode Standard has grown beyond 16 bits.</p>
          <p align="justify">The original members of the Board of Directors of 
          Unicode, Inc. were:</p>
